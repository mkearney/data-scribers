Researchers from Columbia Engineering School developed a new method to non-invasively map the electrical activation of the heart. The technique, called Electromechanical Wave Imaging (EWI), uses ultrasound waves to detect very small deformations following the electrical activation of the heart[... <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](http://www.medgadget.com/archives/2011/05/electromechanical_wave_imaging_noninvasively_maps_electrical_activation_of_the_heart.html)
