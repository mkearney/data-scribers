Much of my research in machine learning is aimed at small-sample, high-dimensional bioinformatics data sets. For instance, here is a paper of mine on the topic. A large number of papers proposing new machine-learning methods that target high-dimensional data use the same two data sets and consider few others[... <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://ramhiser.com/2012/12/29/high-dimensional-microarray-data-sets-in-r-for-machine-learning/)
