There are a lot of explanations of Monte Carlo approximation out there. Here is one that worked for me. A famous mathematician named Stan Ulam liked solitaire. He wanted to work out the probability of getting a perfect solitaire hand. Being a mathematician, he also wanted to work this out analytically. The more trial simulations (iterations) you run, the better the[... <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://www.njtierney.com/post/2013/06/26/monte-carlo-approx/)
