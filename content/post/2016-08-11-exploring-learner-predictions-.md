Learners use features to make predictions but how those features are used is often not apparent. mlr can estimate the dependence of a learned function on a subset of the feature space using generatePartialDependenceData. Partial dependence plots reduce the potentially high dimensional function estimated by the learner, and display a marginalized version of this function in a lower dimensional[... <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://mlr-blog.netlify.com/post/2016-08-11-exploring-learner-predictions-with-partial-dependence/)
