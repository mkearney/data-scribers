[EDIT: Thanks for comments, I created repository with full end-to-end reproducible code. You can find it here - https://github.com/dselivanov/kaggle-outbrain. This is continue of Lessons learned from “Outbrain Click Prediction” kaggle competition (part 1). As a quick recap - we achieved MAP@12 ~ 0.67 which is equal to ~90-100 position on leaderboard. And we didn’t use information about page views from 100gb (30gb compressed) page_views.csv.zip<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](http://dsnotes.com/post/2017-02-07-large-data-feature-hashing-and-online-learning-part-2/)
