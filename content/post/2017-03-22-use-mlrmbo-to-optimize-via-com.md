Many people who want to apply Bayesian optimization want to use it to optimize an algorithm that is not implemented in R but runs on the command line as a shell script or an executable. We recently published mlrMBO on CRAN. As a normal package it normally operates inside of R, but with this post I want to demonstrate how mlrMBO can be used to optimize an external[... <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://mlr-blog.netlify.com/post/2017-03-22-use_mlrmbo_to_optimize_via_command_line/)
