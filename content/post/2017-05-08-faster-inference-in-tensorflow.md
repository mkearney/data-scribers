About inference Using neural networks is primarily made of 2 phases: training your model and using it. The later part can also be called inference, forward pass or evaluation. For most researchers, most of the time is used by training : they have to retrain using different architectures or different parameters[... <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://ndres.me/post/faster-inference-tensorflow/)
