I guess I have it backwards, but I that’s just the way I am. And now that I am a so-called professional, I continue to use simulation to understand models, to do sample size estimates and power calculations, and of course to teach. Sure - I’ll use the occasional formula when one exists, but I always feel the need to check it with...<click to read more>](https://www.rdatagen.net/post/intro-to-simstudy/)
