[updated 01/08/2017 - added CG solver in reco, adjusted results As I promised in last post, I’m going to share benchmark of different implementation of matrix factorization with Weighted Alternating Least Squares. User-Item interaction matrix is made from lastfm-360K dataset. Implementations incude: My reco R package Ben Frederickson implicit python module Apache Spark implementation Quora’s qmf solver For the transparency I’ve created repository with all the<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](http://dsnotes.com/post/2017-07-10-bench-wrmf/)
