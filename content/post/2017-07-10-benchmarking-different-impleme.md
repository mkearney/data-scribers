updated 01/08/2017 - added CG solver in reco, adjusted results As I promised in last post, Iâ€™m going to share benchmark of different implementation of matrix factorization with Weighted Alternating Least Squares. User-Item interaction matrix is made from lastfm-360K[... <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](http://dsnotes.com/post/2017-07-10-bench-wrmf/)
