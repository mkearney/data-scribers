[Simulation can be super helpful for estimating power or sample size requirements when the study design is complex. This approach has some advantages over an analytic one (i.e. one based on a formula), particularly the flexibility it affords in setting up the specific assumptions in the planned study, such as time trends, patterns of missingness, or effects of different levels of...<click to read more>](https://www.rdatagen.net/post/using-simulation-for-power-analysis-an-example/)
