All Subsets Regression What is all subsets regression? It’s a technique for model building which involves taking a set of independent variables \(X_1..i\) and regressing them in sets of \(k\), where \(k\) is in \(\{1,2,\dots,i\}\), against the response variable \(Y\). The ‘all’ part of ‘all subsets’ means it’s every combination of \(X_{1..i}\) being drawn \(k\) at a[... <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](http://thug-r.life/post/2017-08-24-purrr-tricks-with-all-subset-regression/)
