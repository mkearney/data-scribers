I just found out about the R simglm package and decided to do a small simulation to test Little's MCAR test1 under different sample sizes. I could have investigated heteroskedasticity in linear regression instead, and I probably will in the...<click to read more>](https://www.jamesuanhoro.com/post/2017/09/21/littles-mcar-test-at-different-sample-sizes/)
