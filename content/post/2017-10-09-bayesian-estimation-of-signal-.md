[This post is the first part of a series of three blog posts: In the second part, I describe how to estimate the equal variance Gaussian SDT model for multiple participants simultaneously, using hierarchical Bayesian models. In the third part, I describe how to estimate the unequal variance Gaussian SDT model as a hierarchical nonlinear Bayesian...<click to read more>](https://vuorre.netlify.com/post/2017/bayesian-estimation-of-signal-detection-theory-models-part-1/)
