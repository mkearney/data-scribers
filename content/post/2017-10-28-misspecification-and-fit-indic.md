[TLDR: If you have good measurement quality, conventional benchmarks for fit indices may lead to bad decisions. Additionally, global fit indices are not informative for investigating misspecification.

We intend to take this down the IRT route (or ordinal logistic regression), but currently, this is all part of a factor analysis course...<click to read more>](https://www.jamesuanhoro.com/post/2017/10/28/misspecification-and-fit-indices-in-covariance-based-sem/)
