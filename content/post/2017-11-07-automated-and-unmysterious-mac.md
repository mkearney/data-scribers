[First, let's load the data: .. and do some data cleaning: change column names, get rid of the order in factor levels and remove rows with empty cells: That's better! Now, let's set up the local H2O instance... ... and split the data into training, validation and testing datasets. Neural network wins, followed by gradient boost models - no surprise here! Finally, you can use the Leader to predict labels of the testing set: ... and more detailed performance of the<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://r-tastic.co.uk/post/automated-and-unmysterious-machine-learning-in-cancer-detection/)
