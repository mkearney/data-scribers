[Because binary outcomes are less amenable to visual illustration, I am going to stick with model estimation to see how this plays out: We can look directly at the potential outcomes to see the true causal effect, measured as a log odds ratio (LOR): In the linear regression context, the conditional effect measured using observed data from the exposed and unexposed subgroups was in fact a good estimate of the marginal effect in the...<click to read more>](https://www.rdatagen.net/post/inverse-probability-weighting-when-the-outcome-is-binary/)
