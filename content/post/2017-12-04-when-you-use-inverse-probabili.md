[Towards the end of Part 1 of this short series on confounding, IPW, and (hopefully) marginal structural models, I talked a little bit about the fact that inverse probability weighting (IPW) can provide unbiased estimates of marginal causal effects in the context of confounding just as more traditional regression models like OLS can. I used an example based on a normally distributed...<click to read more>](https://www.rdatagen.net/post/inverse-probability-weighting-when-the-outcome-is-binary/)
