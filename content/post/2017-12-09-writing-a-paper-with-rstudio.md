[This semester I had to write a paper for my Financial Econometrics class. My topic was on analyzing the volatility of Bitcoin using GARCH modeling. Iâ€™m not particularly interested in Bitcoin, but with all the recent news around it, and with its highly volatile characteristics, I figured it would be a good candidate for analysis. I did the analysis in R, but I wanted to take it a step further. Could I write the entire paper in R and RStudio in a fairly professional format?<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://blog.davisvaughan.com/post/writing-a-paper-with-rstudio/)
