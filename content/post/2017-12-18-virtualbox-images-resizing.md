[I add to resize an OSGeoLive virtual machine because after a couple postgresql workshops with quite big datasets (less than 1 GB each but still), the default size was not enough. So I followed the instructions from here (in French): http://blogf.leunens.fr/2015/1306/agrandir-la-taille-dun-disque-virtualbox.html Please note that,by default, OSGeoLive cames into a vmdk file so you need to convert it to a VDI to increase the volume size. If you already use a VDI file, not need to do that<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://roelandtn.frama.io/post/virtualbox-images-resizing/)
