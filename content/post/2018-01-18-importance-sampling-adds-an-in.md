(If anyone has great ideas either because you have taught such a course or taken one, definitely drop me a note.) Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is an obvious one. I like the idea of talking about importance sampling , because it sheds light on the idea that not all MC simulations are created...<click to read more>](https://www.rdatagen.net/post/importance-sampling-adds-a-little-excitement-to-monte-carlo-simulation/)
