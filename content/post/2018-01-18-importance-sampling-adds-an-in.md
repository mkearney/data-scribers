[Like many of the topics I’ve written about, this is a vast one that certainly warrants much, much more than a blog entry. MC simulation in particular, since it is so fundamental to the practice of statistics. MC methods are an essential tool to understand the behavior of statistical models. In fact, I’ve probably used MC simulations in just about all of my posts - to generate repeated samples from a model to explore bias, variance, and other distributional characteristics of a particular...<click to read more>](https://www.rdatagen.net/post/importance-sampling-adds-a-little-excitement-to-monte-carlo-simulation/)
