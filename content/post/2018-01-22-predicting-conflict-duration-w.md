[An Unlikely Pairing Last week, Marc Cohen from Google Cloud was on campus to give a hands-on workshop on image classification using TensorFlow. Consequently, I spent most of my time thinking about how I can incorporate image classifiers in my work. As my research is primarily on forecasting armed conflict duration, itâ€™s not really straightforward to make a connection between the...<click to read more>](https://www.gokhan.io/post/keras-conflict/)
