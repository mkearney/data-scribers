This translates to several hours for 150,000 time series, which is kind of not ok. I would prefer it a little faster. Perfect. Now letâ€™s check if we gained some speed up. The speed up is actually ridiculous. Remember that the pracma code ran 40[... <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](http://blog.schochastics.net/post/sample-entropy-with-rcpp/)
