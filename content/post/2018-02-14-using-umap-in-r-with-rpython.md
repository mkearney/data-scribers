[UMAP is constructed from a theoretical framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. The result is a practical scalable algorithm that applies to real world data. The UMAP algorithm is competitive with t-SNE for visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the global structure with superior run time performance. This sounds promising, although the details are not so easy to comprehend. Below is a quick example using the infamous iris data. Here is what the result looks<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](http://blog.schochastics.net/post/using-umap-in-r-with-rpython/)
