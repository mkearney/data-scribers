[Come out to our March event to hear talks from two great R Ladies! First we'll learn about parallelization of simulations with the foreach R package, with applications to progression free survival assessed using electronic health records. Then we'll get an introduction to methods for handling missing data in R. Date: Tuesday, March 20, 2018 Time: 6:30pm Speakers: Elizabeth Sweeney and Mine<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](http://www.rladiesnyc.org/post/parallelization-foreach-and-missing-data/)
