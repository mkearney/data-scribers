[However, this starts to have problems over really large datasets, because the total number of comparisons to be done still rapidly increase besides the use of spatial indexes. A test done by changing the number of points in the above example in the range 25000 - 475000 shows for example this kind of behavior, for two different values of maxdist (500 and 2000 m): On the test dataset, the relationships are almost perfectly quadratic (due to the uniform distribution of...<click to read more>](https://lbusett.netlify.com/post/speeding-up-spatial-analyses-by-integrating-sf-and-data-table-a-test-case/)
