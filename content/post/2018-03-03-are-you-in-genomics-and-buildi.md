[Area Under the Curve (AUC) of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) is a terrible metric for a genomics problem. Do not use it. This metric also goes by AUC or AUROC. Use Precision Recall AUC. First, you do have to use them because everyone uses them and expects them, but try to move them in the supplementary figures. Eventually the field will stop expecting this and demand to see a useful metric - like AUC of Precision Recall. More on this later. The two axes of a ROC are: A larger AUROC is<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](http://davemcg.github.io/./post/are-you-in-genomics-stop-using-roc-use-pr/)
