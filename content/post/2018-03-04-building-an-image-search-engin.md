In this post we’ll be using the pretrained ResNet50 ImageNet weights shipped with Keras as a foundation for building a small image search engine. In the below image we can see some sample output from our final product. As in my last post we’ll be working with app icons that we’re gathered by this scrape script[... <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://adamspannbauer.github.io/2018/03/04/using-keras-to-build-an-image-search-engine/)
