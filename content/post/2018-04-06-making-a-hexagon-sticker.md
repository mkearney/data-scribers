Itâ€™s worth noting about copyright of images since you may like to use images in your hex sticker. If you created the image on your own then the copyright in general will rest with you and there is no problem. If you borrow images from others, you may need to provide attribution depending on their license[... <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://emitanaka.github.io/post/hexsticker/)
