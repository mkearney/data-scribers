[Hi everyone! I have been super swamped with a bunch of due dates that all hit in April. For a small brag, and I like making lists: 9 revise and resubmits (four we've sent back, two have been accepted!) 4 conference posters and one invited talk 1 submitted grant (fingers crossed!) 2 invited papers 2 theses that I'm chairing, 2 that I'm on the committee for Data camp! It's been nuts, so haven't left the house much or done much of anything<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://doomlab.github.io/post/mediation-moderation-workshop/)
