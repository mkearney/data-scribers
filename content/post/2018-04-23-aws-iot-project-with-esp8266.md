Hello there! Today I have completed a POC using ESP8266 as a slave as well as client model which will interface between hardware to provide IOT support. I wish to make this project compatible with AWS so that anyone can deploy their models to S3 and it can serve as a micro service via EC2. I am looking for some research enthusiast people who can work with me[... <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://blog-mjay.firebaseapp.com/post/aws_iot_project/)
