My preferred approach to validating regression models is to simulate data from them, and see if the simulated data capture relevant features of the original data. A basic feature of interest would be the mean. I like this approach because it is extendable to the family of generalized linear models (logistic, Poisson, gamma, ..[... <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://www.jamesuanhoro.com/post/2018/05/07/simulating-data-from-regression-models/)
