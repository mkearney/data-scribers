[As a toy problem, I am going to focus on the application of a Gaussian process model to forecasting future monthly passengers. This is not the only way one could try to solve this prediction problem. I offer it as a means of understanding the potential power that exists in using these sorts of models for prediction and imputation problems involving univariate time series data. First, the data need a bit of prepping to be fed into a Stan program. With the data prepped, I will run the first of two<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://mgb-research.netlify.com/post/gaussian-process-imputation-models/)
