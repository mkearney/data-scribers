[It should be noted that although the bagged trees are identically distributed, they are not necessarily independent. Since the boostrap samples used to train each individual tree come from the same data set, it is not surprising that the trees may share some similar structure. This similarity, known as tree correlation, is an essential factor that prevents further reduction of variance (hence further improvement of performance) for bagged<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://blog.zenggyu.com/en/post/2018-06-05/a-brief-introduction-to-bagged-trees-random-forest-and-their-applications-in-r/)
