[In a previous post, I’ve looked at walking through the calculation of variance and standard deviation, visualizing each step. This post is dedicated to the visualization of another statistic: covariance. Covariance is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables. And now lets apply the equation to the following case: Ready? Okay, now let’s walk through the calculation; there are 7 small steps: That’s<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://evangelinereynolds.netlify.com/post/geometric-covariance/)
