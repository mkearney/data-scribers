[First, lets do this in R. Need some values to work with. Plot the density estimate with the mode location. Lets do something similar in Python. Start by generating a set of random values. Plot to show indeed we have it right. Note we sort the values first so the PDF looks<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](http://rmflight.github.io/post/finding-modes-using-kernel-density-estimates/)
