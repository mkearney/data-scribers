This post is an effort to demonstrate and provide possible solutions for tensorflow's graph problem with PyMC4. Recall that TensorFlow represents calculations as a computation graph, and even for very simple models, the PyMC4 computation graph can be very complex[... <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://sharanry.github.io/post/the-tensorflow-graph-problem/)
