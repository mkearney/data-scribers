The underlying process that generates samples $\tilde{\mathbf{y}} \sim p_{Y}(\mathbf{y})$ is simple to describe, and is of the general form, $$ \tilde{\mathbf{y}} \sim p_{Y}(\mathbf{y}) \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \tilde{\mathbf{y}} = G(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}), \quad \tilde{\mathbf{x}} \sim[... <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://tiao.io/post/building-probability-distributions-with-tensorflow-probability-bijector-api/)
