Welcome to the second post in my From Zero to GPU series. Where I talk about aspects of neural network implementations. In the last post, we have: Trained a simple, feedforward network Deployed it in C++ Got abysmal performance compared to the reference implementation In this post, I'm going to investigate the different optimizations to speed up CPU[... <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://www.nomadic-hacker.com/post/sjb_nn_3_cpu_optimization/)
