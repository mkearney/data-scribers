      <description>This post is my attempt to explain why. A now-infamous article was posted to the Chronicle of Higher Education a couple of weeks ago, discussing some of the issues surrounding the open science movement.

      <description>Where should you declare aesthetics? Globally or in the geom_*() function? The answer to this question, in some sense is personal preference, because there are simply different ways to get the same job done in the ggplot architecture.

Other problems are standard enough that I can rely on other people’s compiled code to do all the work&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The data we’ve scraped only gives a player’s overall ‘ability’ and their abilities on specific skills (e.g. strength, long shots, dribbling…). We want to use this to work out how good each player is at each position. This positional ability score is important as we can’t just select the 11 best players for each team as we might end up playing a goalkeeper and 10 defenders (or&amp;hellip;</description>

For this I turned to the FIFA18 video game which rates players along a variety of scales. Once that’s scraped and bound we can take a peek at the data. There’s 18k players in total and 48 variables for each so we’ll just look at a few for&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Factors terrify me. I can avoid dealing with them most of the time, but they’re immensely useful in a regression when you have a categorical variable with many levels (e.g. “Very Bad”, “Bad”, “Good”, “Very Good”). A common example in economics is when you have a difference-in-differences design and you want to estimate how the treatment effect changes over time, before and after the treatment&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The sudo command is designed to allow users to run programs with the security privileges of another user, by default the root user. In this guide we will show you how to create a new user on a Ubuntu machine and give it sudo access.

      <description>One of the assumptions that comes with applying OLS estimation for regression models in the social sciences is homoskedasticity, I prefer constant error variance (it also goes by spherical disturbances).

      <description>My preferred approach to validating regression models is to simulate data from them, and see if the simulated data capture relevant features of the original data.

      <description>The battle that we’ve all been waiting for. Excel vs. R. Bar plot versus a plot that actually shows the data. Yeah, this isn’t a fair fight. Bar plots are terrible. Why? Simple. They don’t show what your data looks like. A bar plot gives you zero idea how many data points there are. You can add error bars, but you don’t know if you are looking at standard error or standard&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Overview. My approach to teaching centers on the ideas of accessibility, association, and application. As an effective instructor, I strive to ensure that all students are able to orient to and understand material. Often, this process involves formal efforts to reduce barriers to their learning and/or facilitate a stronger grasp of material through association with things they already&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I have read that the most common model for analyzing ordinal data is the cumulative link logistic model, coupled with the proportional odds assumption. Essentially, you treat the outcome as if it were the categorical manifestation of a continuous latent variable. The predictor variables of this outcome influence it in one way only, so you get a single regression coefficient for each&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Today I am using the RISmed package for R to analyze publications about triathlon. It is an amazing package to look through the Pubmed database for what they have on a certain subject. Pubmed is a NIH (USA) funded database which hosts articles about medicine and biology.

      <description>The task here is to try to determine how likely a string is to have a particular set of labels. We can take a look at the data The first step for looking at the actual text is to split up the strings into words and then remove stop words. Stop words like “the” and “a” are unlikely to provide much information about the toxicity of the comment, so we can take them&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Certainly, group membership is not necessarily intrinsically ordered. In a general categorical or multinomial outcome, a group does not necessarily have any quantitative relationship vis a vis the other groups.

In this case, I need the ability to tell the test what function I want it to&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>That said, the number of sightings in each state has seen a steady climb since 2000. My guess is that due to prominence of search engines, awareness of NUFORC (and thus, the likelihood of reporting) has increased. You can follow the trend with the boxplots below. Each state contributes their count for a given year, and the boxplot helps give a sense how much they vary from each&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Curious to know the answer, I looked at each draft class since 1989 (when the draft was changed to two rounds) and their performance in that year’s season. To be clear, this is only looking at immediate contribution, and not long-term success. Only those who played the same year they were drafted are being considered- so players like Joel Embiid, who did not play their first year, are not in the&amp;hellip;</description>

For those of you who don’t know, RDS is an easy way to create a database in the cloud. In this post, I won’t be showing you how to setup an RDS instance, but I will show you how to connect to it if you have one running.</description>

      <description>Again, the specifics of the simulation are not important here.

      <description>Introduction At source{d} we&amp;rsquo;ve been using Go for almost two years. Until machine learning came along, Go was the only language in which we needed to use our data models. Right now, Python is playing a bigger role in our platform and Scala is joining as another&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>As more enterprises start transitioning over to using AWS, cost optimisation has become a hot topic. Andy and I were recently given the opportunity to explore the potential savings of running on spot instances. What are spot instances? Spare compute capacity that Amazon Web Services (AWS) sells at a discounted price. When a user requests a spot instance, they must also provide a ‘bid&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>One problem with data analysis is that you often need to make critical decisions before you really understand the problem. Since data analysis is always somewhat exploratory you can often make some bad decisions in the early stages of your analysis which can cause lots of problems later&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Sometimes there is a situation, when it is more efficient to parse the JSON in stream way. Especially if you are dealing with huge input or slow connection. In that case the JSON need to be read as it comes from input part by part. The side effect of such approach is that you are able to read corrupted JSON arrays in some kind of comfortable&amp;hellip;</description>
