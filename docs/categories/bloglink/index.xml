      <description>There are good reasons to get into deep learning: Deep learning has been outperforming the respective &amp;ldquo;classical&amp;rdquo; techniques in areas like image recognition and natural language processing for a while now, and it has the potential to bring interesting insights even to the analysis of tabular&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I think it is more straight forward than messing around with alpha. Several folks brought up geom_blank() having looked at the previous implementation, but I didn’t find it necessary in this case if you are using last_plot() which I think it makes sense to do in this context. Still, geom_blank is good to know about&amp;hellip;</description>

My preference is declaring all aesthetic mappings as global unless there are conflicts&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The “random walk on CRAN” project, however, has been on hold for a bit - and in truth today’s post is a bit of a cop out because there’s no package here at all and barely anything resembling code. Instead, it’s some initial thoughts about how to revisit some of my teaching material. For today though, I have a different goal… But still, it’s nice to think about what we might do if we have more&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>My limited goals: Perhaps the central difference between working in the Stata environment and in R is that in R you always have to be declaring which data frame you are working with.

      <description>First of all, the main purpose of caching is speed. The basic idea is simple: if you know you are going to compute the same thing, you may just load the result saved from the previous run, and skip the computing this time. There are two keywords here: &amp;ldquo;the same thing&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;the saved result&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;</description>

This translates to several hours for 150,000 time series, which is kind of not ok. I would prefer it a little faster. Perfect. Now let’s check if we gained some speed up. The speed up is actually ridiculous&amp;hellip;</description>
