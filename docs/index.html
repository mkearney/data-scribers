						A popular workflow in R uses {dplyr} to group_by() and then summarise() 1 variables. It&rsquo;s an intuitive and easy way to aggregate and describe data, especially along multiple dimensions.

						Creating or determination of regions is a useful way to describe the world. Regionalization does not only allow for a quicker understanding of spatial patterns but also can influence how regions are managed. Regions are created in various disciplines. We can delineate regions based on a single property (e.g. landform regions or climate regions) or several factors (e.g. ecoregions). There are also political regions divided by borders that are established through political or social&hellip;

Or at least, early indicators are in, and based on 22 cases, some of which required a great deal of manual editing, the program is returning estimates in line with expectations. Backing up, as I trip a little over my excitement, IBI VizEdit is an Rshiny application I created to help our lab process and edit heart rate&hellip;

The particular instrument has five questions related to mobility, self-care, activities, pain, and anxiety. Each item has three possible responses: (1) no problems, (2) some problems, and (3) a lot of&hellip;
