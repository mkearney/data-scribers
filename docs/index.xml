      <description>I still remember how hard it was to learn {ggplot2} after only knowing a little about R 1 . Sure, the plots seemed pretty. But compared to the ways I had used R before, {ggplot2} &amp;rsquo;s syntax seemed almost counter-intuitive. Its pipe-like + workflow–building layer-by-layer– was like nothing I had ever used&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>A popular workflow in R uses {dplyr} to group_by() and then summarise() 1 variables. It&amp;rsquo;s an intuitive and easy way to aggregate and describe data, especially along multiple dimensions. The cost of being both powerful and user-friendly, however, is its arguably inconvenient default method for assigning names to summarized values. As the code illustrates below, users can provide their own names when using&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>This post has lots in common with previous posts on “the layered presentation of graphics”. It is about building up plots, but now with a focus on this incramental change for teaching ggplot2. The rational is that observing the cause and effect of incremental change is easier to digest, and that the repetition in this approach means students have more chances to learn the ggplot2 functions. My recent tweet presented the technique: Here, building up a #ggplot2 as slowly as possible,&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>As of now, Sep. 11th, 2018, Hurricane Florence (Category 4) is approaching to eastern coastal areas of United States. There are many ways to track the path of hurricanes (or typhoons) to conduct further analysis, such as flash flooding, ocean surge and property damages. In this blog, the author tries to plot the tracking of hurricanes, using both stastic and animated maps, with the help of R and related packages.

      <description>Creating or determination of regions is a useful way to describe the world. Regionalization does not only allow for a quicker understanding of spatial patterns but also can influence how regions are managed. Regions are created in various disciplines. We can delineate regions based on a single property (e.g. landform regions or climate regions) or several factors (e.g. ecoregions). There are also political regions divided by borders that are established through political or social&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>An economist contacted me about the ability of simstudy to generate correlated ordinal categorical outcomes. He is trying to generate data as an aide to teaching cost-effectiveness analysis, and is hoping to simulate responses to a quality-of-life survey instrument, the EQ-5D. The particular instrument has five questions related to mobility, self-care, activities, pain, and anxiety. Each item has three possible responses: (1) no problems, (2) some problems, and (3) a lot of&amp;hellip;</description>

I have been much slower recently on the posts, I will probably be until the end of july, because of work for my PhD, so I&amp;rsquo;m sorry about that.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got some opinions about how to write ggplot code. They are based off of the official style guide , with a few of my own additions specific to ggplot2. Starting with argument names / newlines So, if there are more than two sections in a function, these should be separated on a newline. Ideally, all functions should have their argument names&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>It was a year ago today that I launched this website with a post introducing myself and the goals for the blog. When I launched the site, I was at the beginning of teaching myself about digital humanities and how to code in R. Building this Hugo site was part of my learning process. I learned about the command line, Git, and GitHub, not to mention a bit of HTML and CSS to get the website up and&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Factors terrify me. I can avoid dealing with them most of the time, but they’re immensely useful in a regression when you have a categorical variable with many levels (e.g. “Very Bad”, “Bad”, “Good”, “Very Good”). A common example in economics is when you have a difference-in-differences design and you want to estimate how the treatment effect changes over time, before and after the treatment period. Here’s a toy&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>One of the assumptions that comes with applying OLS estimation for regression models in the social sciences is homoskedasticity, I prefer constant error variance (it also goes by spherical disturbances). It implies that there is no systematic pattern to the error variance, meaning the model is equally poor at all levels of prediction. This assumption is important for OLS to be the best linear unbiased predictor&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>As a digital nomad traveling with 2 dogs, keeping track of all their medical and vaccine records has been challenging. Especially since one of our dogs has had some recent health issues. I needed a way to organize all the vet visits, test results, vaccine certificates, etc. as well as be able to share them with new vets and our primary vet back in Colorado. Thus, an R Shiny app was&amp;hellip;</description>

After cleaning the data (making it skinner by switching cars to columns and years to rows) and saving it to the name “ev_csv_3”, it was time to plot. In order to have multiple y-axis lines, simply skip entering a y argument in the aes function in the first line of the ggplot&amp;hellip;</description>

MRI-neuroanatomy – the study of the sizes of brain regions – is a wonderful tool for this job and makes up a sizeable chunk of what we study. MRI operates in a lovely middle ground in the scales of neuroscience. It is strongly related to macroscale features of the organism, including sex, behaviour, etc; but can also inform us about the effects of microscale factors – such as gene&amp;hellip;</description>

The Allen Brain Institute (ABI) has acquired and released genome-wide spatial gene expression maps for the mouse brain. The data is generated using in situ hybridization experiments (ISH), where nucleotide probes for specific genes bind directly to mouse brain&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The answer is probably no, because there is a not-so-low chance (perhaps considerably higher than 5%) you will draw the wrong conclusions from the study. I have heard variations on this question not so infrequently, so I thought it would be useful (of course) to do a few quick simulations to see what happens when we try to conduct a study under these&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Simulating data is super useful for testing methods and data science interview prep Simulation is a great way to study statistics. If you’re picking up a method for the first time, (e.g., from the Udacity AB testing course) it’s too easy to convince yourself you know what’s going on without actually doing the math or programming. For example, when I see binary treatments and outcomes, I wonder “would I get the same answer if I do binomial proportion test&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Motivation I’ll skip the part where I tell you why A/B testing is important. Just look at any data science team in tech, Microsoft, Airbnb, Twitter, Facebook, etc. etc. And I’m starting to see this statement often: The variance that pre-experiment data can explain in a metric is unrelated to any effects of the experiment and can, therefore, be removed.

      <description>Outcome Supervision Yesterday I was part of an introductory session on machine learning and unsurprisingly, the issue of supervised vs. unsupervised learning came up. In social sciences, there is a definite tendency for the former; there is more or less always a target outcome or measure that we want to optimise the performance of our models for. This reminded me of a draft that I had written the code a couple of months ago but for some reason never converted into a blog post until&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I have read that the most common model for analyzing ordinal data is the cumulative link logistic model, coupled with the proportional odds assumption.

      <description>Visualising Distributions Visualising Linear Discriminant Analysis Shiny had interested me for a while for it’s power to quickly communicate and vizualise data and models. I hadn’t delved into it due to lack of time to do so, until now. Two quick visualizations I’ve created as my 1st foray into R Shiny. Nothing earth shattering, but was helpful to learn the tool.

      <description>Was Jalen Rose really the first Jalen? He claims his mother was the first to make up the name, a combo of his father’s (the NBA player Jimmie Walker) and uncle’s (Leonard) names. And now we see them everywhere: Jalen Hurts (the Alabama QB that was benched in the national title game a few weeks ago) and Jalen Ramsey (Jags cornerback). Was he really? On the other hand, Shaq is an equally distinct name, what happened after he got&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I add to resize an OSGeoLive virtual machine because after a couple postgresql workshops with quite big datasets (less than 1 GB each but still), the default size was not enough. So I followed the instructions from here (in French): http://blogf.leunens.fr/2015/1306/agrandir-la-taille-dun-disque-virtualbox.html Please note that,by default, OSGeoLive cames into a vmdk file so you need to convert it to a VDI to increase the volume size.

When assessing the fit of structural equation models, it is common for applied researchers to dismiss the $\chi^2$ test because it will almost always detect a statistically significant discrepancy between your model and the data, given a large enough sample&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Seasonality and Trends Time-series analysis is a battle on multiple fronts by definition. One has to deal with (dynamic) trends, seasonality effects, and good old noise. A general formula can be given as y = level + trend + seasonality + noise However, the relationships between these factors can be realized in many, and sometimes quite complex, ways. It is easy to over-fit noise, and the window for accurate prediction can be quite small (think of funnel-shaped confidence&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I’m exploring the idea of adding a function or set of functions to the simstudy package that would make it possible to easily generate non-linear data. One way to do this would be using B-splines. Typically, one uses splines to fit a curve to data, but I thought it might be useful to switch things around a bit to use the underlying splines to generate data. This would facilitate exploring models where we know the assumption of linearity is&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Today I encountered an error in the tidyverse that took me a while to figure out, so I wanted to document it for others. I’m also not sure where this error originates, so I wasn’t positive which package to post it in (or with RStudio) - I’d be happy to submit a bug report if anyone can point me in the right direction :) The Scenario You have a data frame you want to alter using piping, something like&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>TLDR: Little&amp;rsquo;s MCAR test is unable to tell data that are MCAR from data that are MAR in small samples, but maintains the nominal error rate when null is true across a wide range of sample sizes. I just found out about the R simglm package and decided to do a small simulation to test Little&amp;rsquo;s MCAR test1 under different sample sizes. I could have investigated heteroskedasticity in linear regression instead, and I probably will in the&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>TLDR: When performing a simple linear regression, if you have any concern about outliers or heterosedasticity, consider the Theil-Sen estimator. A simple linear regression estimator that is not commonly used or taught in the social sciences is the Theil-Sen estimator. This is a shame given that this estimator is very intuitive, once you know what a slope&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>TLDR: In small samples, the wild bootstrap implemented in the R hcci package is a good bet when heteroskedasticity is a concern. Today while teaching the multiple regression lab, I showed the class the standardized residuals versus standardized predictor plot SPSS lets you produce. It is the plot we typically use to assess homoskedasticity. The sample size for the analysis was 44. I mentioned how the regression slopes are fine under heteroskedasticity, but inference $(t, SE, pvalue)$ may be&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>With the new Premier League season kicking off, I plan to produce plenty of posts over the coming months I have yet to organize it all but the idea is to present tables and charts without embedded code. Hopefully, I will get around to publishing it on Github So let’s start of with a couple of different areas of interest Starting survivors220 keen players will start the season - but how often does the Game one starting lineup reflect who plays most for the team throughout the&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Just over one year ago, I met Robin in Poznan, Poland, who was teaching as part of the GEOCENTRUM project at the Adam Mickiewicz University. To our surprise, we found that we shared an idea of writing a book explaining how to use R for spatial data analysis. The timing worked well. Over the next few months, Robin finished Phase II of his project ( the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) ) and I completed my PhD and moved to Cincinnati to work in Space Informatics&amp;hellip;</description>

We do this to obtain spatial information about the chemical composition of a sample on the nanoscale. Basically, an image is obtained by raster-scanning the electron beam and recording an X-ray spectrum in each position. This effectively gives a 3-dimensional dataset, where for each pixel a full spectrum is&amp;hellip;</description>

Nowadays, I have been building interactive web applications, mainly Shiny apps and dashboards, for work and as a hobby. Consequently, I needed a central hub to host all the apps in one&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I learned statistics and probability by simulating data. Sure, I did the occasional proof, but I never believed the results until I saw it in a simulation. I guess I have it backwards, but I that’s just the way I am. And now that I am a so-called professional, I continue to use simulation to understand models, to do sample size estimates and power calculations, and of course to teach. Sure - I’ll use the occasional formula when one exists, but I always feel the need to check it with&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>It goes without saying that there are always many ways to solve a problem in R, but clearly some ways are better (for example, faster) than others. Recently, I found myself in a situation where I could not find a way to avoid using a loop, and I was immediately concerned, knowing that I would want this code to be flexible enough to run with a very large number of observations, possibly over many observations.</description>

My first instinct was to get out of the R environment and write CSnippets for the pomp package (more on this in a later blog), or to use RCpp , but I used the profvis package to help diagnose the speed issues, and found a really simple change that can save a ton of time depending on your model.</description>

      <description>I have consistently been interested in assessing music information in R, for example my - somewhat dormant -charts dashboard A recent, excellent, blog post by RCharlie featuring the Spotify and Genius APIs to determine a ‘Gloom Index’ for Radiohead tracks piqued my interest.

      <description>ggedit is a package that lets users interactively edit ggplot layer and theme aesthetics. In a previous post we showed you how to use it in a collaborative workflow using standard R scripts. More importantly, we highlighted that ggedit outputs to the user, after editing, updated: gg plots, layers, scales and themes as both self-contained objects and script that you can paste directly in your code&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>It was two o’clock on a Tuesday afternoon and Abigail* was in the emergency room for the third time this month. I was able to step away from the day-to-day struggles of the general inpatient medicine floors to see her in the emergency department. I had promised to keep her out of the hospital, and I had failed again. As I entered the commotion of the emergency room, I scanned above each door looking for room 33, Abigail’s&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>In a previous post , I used data from Statsguru and looked at a brief history of cricket with respect to debut years and career spans of players. In this post, I use detailed player statistics from the same dataset to select top batsmen who have played this game. Distribution of matches played by all players Let’s take a look at the summary statistics of number of matches played by all players in each format of the&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The shinydashboard package provides functions like valueBox that conveniently display basic information like summary statistics. In addition to presenting a value and subtitle on a colored background, an icon may be included as well. However, the icon must come from either the Font Awesome or Glyphicon icon libraries and cannot be image files. I&amp;rsquo;ve provided a gist that shows how to achieve the use of custom icons with local image files stored in an app&amp;rsquo;s www/&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Making reproducible examples can be hard. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of things you need to consider. Like, making sure your environment is clean, the right packages are loaded, the code is formatted nicely, and images are the right resolution and dimension. Getting all of these ducks lined up can sometimes take a couple of minutes, if you have a nice tightly defined problem. Other times, it can take much, much&amp;hellip;</description>
