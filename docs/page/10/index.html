						Ideally, a study that uses randomization provides a balance of characteristics that might be associated with the outcome being studied. This way, we can be more confident that any differences in outcomes between the groups are due to the group assignments and not to differences in characteristics. Unfortunately, randomization does not guarantee balance, especially with smaller sample&hellip;

						Many people who want to apply Bayesian optimization want to use it to optimize an algorithm that is not implemented in R but runs on the command line as a shell script or an executable. We recently published mlrMBO on CRAN. As a normal package it normally operates inside of R, but with this post I want to demonstrate how mlrMBO can be used to optimize an external application. At the same time I will highlight some issues you can likely run&hellip;
