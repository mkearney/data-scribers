						Hi athletes. I recently went to a Multiple Sclerosis (MS) conference in Paris organized by the ARSEP foundation, mostly to see what people are doing on the immunology side of the disease, and I started looking into the foundation a bit more and that&rsquo;s how I started doing this article. Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory disease of the Central Nervous System (CNS). It is an auto-immune disease which means that our own immune system attacks&hellip;

I thought it would be interesting to share some thoughts and discussion that I&rsquo;ve been having about naming packages.
