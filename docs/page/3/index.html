						The tiler package provides a map tile-generator function for creating map tile sets for use with packages such as leaflet . In addition to generating map tiles based on a common raster layer source, it also handles the non-geographic edge case, producing map tiles from arbitrary images. These map tiles, which have a “simple CRS”, a non-geographic simple Cartesian coordinate reference system, can also be used with leaflet when applying the simple CRS&hellip;

A common example in economics is when you have a difference-in-differences design and you want to estimate how the treatment effect changes over time, before and after the treatment period.
