						My previous post provided an introduction to the sp and sf packages, showing how the two packages represent spatial data in R. There I discussed the creation of Spatial and sf objects from data with longitude and latitude values and the process of making maps with the two packages. In this post I will go further into the details of the sf package by examining the structure of sf objects and how the package implements the Simple Features open&hellip;

						Intro Figuring out how one group’s brain is different from another’s is a big part of neuroscience. MRI-neuroanatomy – the study of the sizes of brain regions – is a wonderful tool for this job and makes up a sizeable chunk of what we study. MRI operates in a lovely middle ground in the scales of neuroscience. It is strongly related to macroscale features of the organism, including sex, behaviour, etc; but can also inform us about the effects of microscale factors – such as gene&hellip;
