						The 2018 Winter Olympics finally kicked off! In honor of this, I asked a friend of mine who loves sports what data he would be interested in seeing in the sports that are in the winter Olympics and he answered &ldquo;biathlon.&rdquo; I found a website that collects lots of data on the sport called biathlonresults.com. I was really looking forward to the olympics this year, and France has a very famous biathlete, Martin Fourcade, so that makes me keen to look more into this&hellip;

						So, peaks. When producing a statistical map, it’s good to get a report of the peaks (i.e. most significant findings). RMINC has had this support for a while now, though it has remained somewhat hidden. Here’s a bit of an intro, then. I will walk through the example we used from the Mouse Imaging Summer School in 2017, which is data from this paper: de Guzman AE, Gazdzinski LM, Alsop RJ, Stewart JM, Jaffray DA, Wong CS, Nieman&hellip;

To lead up to PSIS-LOO I will introduce Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) to lay the foundation for model selection in general, then cover the expected log predictive density, the corner stone of bayesian model&hellip;

						Well, maybe you haven’t, but this seems to come up all the time. An investigator wants to assess the effect of an intervention on a outcome.

For each participant, the outcome measure is recorded at baseline - this is the pre in pre/post&hellip;
