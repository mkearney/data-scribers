						<p><a href="http://www.robert-hickman.eu/post/yorkshire_world_cup_2/">The data we’ve scraped only gives a player’s overall ‘ability’ and their abilities on specific skills (e.g. strength, long shots, dribbling…). We want to use this to work out how good each player is at each position. This positional ability score is important as we can’t just select the 11 best players for each team as we might end up playing a goalkeeper and 10 defenders (or etc.). We need to make sure we select the best palyers for each position on a realistic&hellip;<click to read more></a></p>

						<p><a href="https://blog.zenggyu.com/en/post/2018-06-05/a-brief-introduction-to-bagged-trees-random-forest-and-their-applications-in-r/">It should be noted that although the bagged trees are identically distributed, they are not necessarily independent. Since the boostrap samples used to train each individual tree come from the same data set, it is not surprising that the trees may share some similar structure. This similarity, known as tree correlation, is an essential factor that prevents further reduction of variance (hence further improvement of performance) for bagged&hellip;<click to read more></a></p>
