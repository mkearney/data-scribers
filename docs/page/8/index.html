This would facilitate exploring models where we know the assumption of linearity is&hellip;

					<p>
						regexSelect is a small package that uses Shiny modules to solve a problem in Shiny selectize objects - regular expression (regex) searching. You can quickly filter the values in the selectize object, while being able to add that new regex query to the selectize list. This is great for long lists, since you can return multiple item simultaneously without needing to endlessly click items in a list!&hellip;

						TLDR: Little&rsquo;s MCAR test is unable to tell data that are MCAR from data that are MAR in small samples, but maintains the nominal error rate when null is true across a wide range of sample sizes. I just found out about the R simglm package and decided to do a small simulation to test Little&rsquo;s MCAR test1 under different sample sizes. I could have investigated heteroskedasticity in linear regression instead, and I probably will in the&hellip;

						TLDR: When performing a simple linear regression, if you have any concern about outliers or heterosedasticity, consider the Theil-Sen estimator. A simple linear regression estimator that is not commonly used or taught in the social sciences is the Theil-Sen estimator. This is a shame given that this estimator is very intuitive, once you know what a slope&hellip;

						TLDR: In small samples, the wild bootstrap implemented in the R hcci package is a good bet when heteroskedasticity is a concern. Today while teaching the multiple regression lab, I showed the class the standardized residuals versus standardized predictor plot SPSS lets you produce. It is the plot we typically use to assess homoskedasticity. The sample size for the analysis was 44. I mentioned how the regression slopes are fine under heteroskedasticity, but inference $(t, SE, pvalue)$ may be&hellip;
