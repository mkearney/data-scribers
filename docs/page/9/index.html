						When Babe Ruth first retired from baseball he found it tough. Without the protection of the Yankees PR department his various, and widespread, indiscretions were fodder for the yellow press and the reluctance of anyone to give him a managerial position was humiliating So he became a virtual recluse mainly fly-fishing, painting water-colours and studying the lives of contemporary&hellip;

						On the front page of my premiersoccerstats site, I have a Player Milestones table which highlights players who have reached certain levels in the Premier League’s latest round of games e.g. 100 Appearances This requires comparing two datasets and subsetting the rows with differences in the variable of interest. To this end, I use the daff package which was the subject of a presentation at the recent R User 2017&hellip;

						I love football. It’s the greatest sport ever. And I mean real football not what is played in America. I wanted to be a footballer for ages but now I’m 28 and I still haven’t signed any multi million pound contracts, I think I’ll give up on that. The next best thing is watching football and I do that, a lot. Particularly the red half of Manchester as quite a few Londoners do :p.
