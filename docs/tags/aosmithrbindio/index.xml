      <description>This isnâ€™t necessarily an incorrect thing to do. However, I think it is important to step back and think about the study and those 0 values more before forging ahead with adding a constant to the data. Without getting into too much detail, below are some of the things I consider when I have 0 as well as positive values in a response variable&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I started out thinking Iâ€™d talk about doing simulations. But could I do that in 45 minutes? Maybe not. After much pondering I ended up settling on the topic of how we start a simulation: by making data in R&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>When you have a lot of variables and need to make a lot exploratory plots itâ€™s usually worthwhile to automate the process in R instead of manually copying and pasting code for every plot&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>It would be nice to know which line came from which model, and adding a legend is one way to do that&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>One of the things I like about simulations is that, with practice, they can be a quick way to check your intuition about a model or relationship. My most recent example is based on a discussion with a student about quadratic effects&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Since Iâ€™m going generate random numbers Iâ€™ll set the seed so anyone following along at home will see the same values. The output below is a list of three vectors&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>It wasnâ€™t until I started working with clients and teaching labs on mixed models in R that I learned how to do simulations to understand how well such models worked under various scenarios&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Winter term grades are in and I can once again scrape together some time to write blog posts! ðŸŽ‰ I find this comes up particularly for generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), where models donâ€™t always converge if explanatory variables are left&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Last week two of my consulting meetings ended up on the same topic: making added variable plots. In both cases, the student had a linear model of some flavor that had several continuous explanatory variables&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Confession: I love simulations. In simulations you get to define everything about a model and then see how that model behaves over the long run. Itâ€™s like getting the luxury of taking many samples instead of only the one real one we have resources for in an actual study&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Itâ€™s January - time to see how we did on car gas mileage last year! We purchased a used 2011 Ford Fiesta in 2016. It replaced a 1991 Honda CRX, which was running like a champ but was starting to look a little, well, limited in its safety features&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>At least once a year I meet with a graduate student who has many separate datasets that need to be combined into a single file. The data are usually from a series of data loggers (e.g., iButtons or RFID readers) that record data remotely over a specified time period&amp;hellip;</description>
