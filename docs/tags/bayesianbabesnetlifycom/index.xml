      <description>We learned so much from Hamdan Azhar&amp;rsquo;s awesome Prismoji tutorial after seeing his wonderful talk at the Southern Data Science Conference. In order to better aquaint ourselves with messy twitter data, we performed a simple search of the emojis associated with&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Say we have a fruit bowl&amp;ndash;mmm!&amp;ndash;consisting of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries. There are 50 strawberry slices, 20 blueberries, 15 raspberries, and 15 blackberries. If each fruit has an equal probability of being selected, then the probability of selecting any one fruit is 1 out of the total number of fruit,&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>As a hungry botanist I couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of a more a-peel-ing metaphor than fruit. Let&amp;rsquo;s say we have a fruit bowl consisting of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries. There are 50 strawberries, 20 blueberries, 15 raspberries, and 15&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Assume your cat just had a litter of kittens. Con-cat-ulations! However, you suspect you will soon have five different paws gently tapping your face in the morning when you are sleeping. How many of these paws will be the left paw and how many will be the right? Assume the probability of having a left-handed kitten is 25% and a right-handed kitten is&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Question (1) What methods are necessary to find significant covariates? (2) How do different strata effect our coefficients? (3) Must strata be defined a priori or can we find the stratification of 5 intercept groups within our data set? Simulation To answer our question, we will simulate 1000 plants with 5 different genotypes which will vary by&amp;hellip;</description>
