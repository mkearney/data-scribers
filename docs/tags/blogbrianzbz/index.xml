      <description>For quite some time, SQLAlchemy has been my go-to database toolkit and ORM for Python microservices and Serverless projects.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been quite some time since a blog post went up here. The reason for this is mainly due to my book with Packt Publishing, Serverless Design Patterns and Best Practices. Happily I can say that it&amp;rsquo;s published and I can turn my technical attention to other things. In chapters 2 and 3, I walk through setting up serverless REST and GraphQL APIs, respectively&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on a book for Packt publishing titled Serverless Design Patterns and Best Practices. While writing and whipping out tons of examples is quite a bit of work, and I sometimes curse myself for agreeing to this, I&amp;rsquo;m quite excited as I work through the chapters and as it comes together&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>In a previous post I introduced and discussed about an open source library I authored called Servant. Servant is a framework for building RPC-style services with Python. Servant is to services as Django or Rails is to web applications&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s framework you&amp;rsquo;d use when you need to build a service in Python&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Following up from my last post about serverless systems, let&amp;rsquo;s do a walk-through of the Serverless project. Getting started As usual I&amp;rsquo;ll demo this using a Docker container. You can check out the code on Github and follow along: https://github.com/brianz/serverless-demo. This Docker image has Serverless v0.5.5&amp;hellip;and that&amp;rsquo;s about it&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty exciting (and challenging) time to build software-based applications. Every week there are more and more tools to make our jobs easier or to enable us to focus on application development rather than dealing with the infrastructure around those applications&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re a developer and don&amp;rsquo;t live under a rock you&amp;rsquo;ve undoubtedly heard of Docker.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a very very long time since I&amp;rsquo;ve posted anything publicly. Blogging has drastically changed since the early days.

For a while I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to contribute back&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;m constantly learning new things and some of them are really useful&amp;hellip;</description>
