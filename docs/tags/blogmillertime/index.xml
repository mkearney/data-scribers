      <description>When I interact with most code repositories they&amp;rsquo;re often hosted on Github, or Gitlab, or some other managed Git service. By and large HTTPS support is a foregone conclusion; I never have issues using git commands or GUI clients to interact with those repositories&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the Docker for Windows beta lately and things have been going rather smoothly.
