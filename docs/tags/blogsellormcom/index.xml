It doesn’t really do a great deal, but you can use it to install one package at a time. Save the below as rpkginstall and make sure it’s executable with chmod + x rpkginstall. Then you can install a package like this example, which would install dplyr, &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>On Monday night, I went over to the Data Science meet up in Oxford. Even though the parking ticket machines in Oxford don’t accept ‘new’ 5 or 10 pence pieces, despite both having been in circulation for over 20 years, it was a good night.

      <description>SQL relay in Cardiff is part of the wider SQL Relay UK family and is essentially a free, touring conference, targeted at DBA’s (especially MS SQL Server) and BI users.
