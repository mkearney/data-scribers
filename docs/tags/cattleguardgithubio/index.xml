      <description>Google released their CausalImpact package a few years ago and when they did my mind started racing with ideas for information security and information risk applications. Imagine if you could propose a control, policy change or process improvement with an expected effect on a response variable, which would lead you to purposefully defining a way to measure intervention outcomes&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I started playing around a bit (again) in Go recently and had a need to take a look at some requests I was generating. I wanted to take a look in ZAP to see how things were working and use that to make adjustments, etc. Post is no big deal, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to forget how to do this. Also, there are several posts that don&amp;rsquo;t seem to actually work&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Before we get too far down the trail on this, I’ll warn readers that this is a pink and blue post. It’s simple prediction using an interesting R package. It’s important to consider the stakes (pun intended), when “enriching” a dataset with information that might introduce bias&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Now, I look for faster playback on everything and am kind of suprised when I can&amp;rsquo;t find it. However, I use one of these for my music and podcasts. iPod Classic If you&amp;rsquo;re on OSX there are several free plist generators so that you can get it loaded by launchctl&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>For miles down I-40 you&amp;rsquo;ll see billboards for this restaurant and brewery advertising a free 72oz steak, if you can eat it. An office debate erupted amongst two of my colleagues over just what types of people end up beating the beast. They argued. I fired up rvest&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>While killing time on Twitter the other day a Techlahoma tweet featuring WebVR and A-Frame grabbed my attention. If you know me, I’ve been excited about VR and AR for sometime (despite not having any VR or AR capable equipment). So, a color changing sphere that bounces is still fairly fun for me&amp;hellip;</description>

A stoplight is placed at the end of an on ramp which regulates how many cars are allowed onto a highway at a given time. The idea being that the number of required slowdowns and wrecks decreases as cars have appropriate distance. Waiting sucks&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I drink quite a bit of coffee. It&amp;rsquo;s true. Occasionally it comes up in conversation. It occurs that someone is bored with their beans and wants to class up their caffeine delivery. Maybe this is you. Well, here are some of my favorites as of late. Check them out. I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to keep my notes here, but I don&amp;rsquo;t plan on spamming the RSS with updates&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Yesterday, a tweet caught my eye. It was something that I know I’d seen before, but it somehow had escaped my memory as to what it was called or how it was constructed. Well, it bugged me enough that I had to track it down. As I am currently neck deep in writing an annual risk report it’d be easy for me to agree with the thought&amp;hellip;</description>
