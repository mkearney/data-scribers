      <description>It contains cell area size for thousands of cells which have had a drug perturbation, split by wells in a dish. One drug per well. Several wells got the same drugs. So there are multiple plots per drug. How did I know? Because a bunch of the density plots were super wavy - which means (almost always) that the number of counts in that sample is very low&amp;hellip;</description>
