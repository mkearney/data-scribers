      <description>This post is my attempt to explain why. A now-infamous article was posted to the Chronicle of Higher Education a couple of weeks ago, discussing some of the issues surrounding the open science movement. I‚Äôm not going to link to the article itself because it‚Äôs a very bad take on what the open science movement should be about (and I think most people agreed on&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Not surprisingly most of the posts (about 75% of them) were written in the first half of the project. That‚Äôs partly the inevitable consequence of the novelty wearing off, but it also there have been a few other things that have come up along the way‚Ä¶ One big thing that interacted with this 100Days project in positive way is my teaching&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm getting to the very end of this package tryout exercise, and I suspect this will be the last post (other than perhaps a wrap up on Friday). It‚Äôs been a mildly annoying morning: I‚Äôve done something to my foot, I‚Äôve been awake since 4am, and somehow my twitter feed was full of people talking about Jordan Peterson üòí&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The motivation to face the fear is similarly straightforward: my R code runs too slowly for some of the problems I care about. It doesn‚Äôt come up that often, to be honest. Most problems I work on are small enough that it really doesn‚Äôt matter that my R code is slow. Other problems are standard enough that I can rely on other people‚Äôs compiled code to do all the work&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The ‚Äúrandom walk on CRAN‚Äù project, however, has been on hold for a bit - and in truth today‚Äôs post is a bit of a cop out because there‚Äôs no package here at all and barely anything resembling code. Instead, it‚Äôs some initial thoughts about how to revisit some of my teaching material. For today though, I have a different goal‚Ä¶ But still, it‚Äôs nice to think about what we might do if we have more&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Not wanting to give away the list of things that might appear on bingo cards (or alternatively, not actually having written all the items yet!)
