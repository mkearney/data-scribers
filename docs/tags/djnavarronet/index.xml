      <description>Very often I encounter students who are quiet, thoughtful and tend not to speak much. This is totally okay - not everyone in the classroom needs to be talking a lot. On the other hand, I also notice that very often those same students will sometimes talk to me afterwards about a topic and (surprise!) it turns out that they’ve had some deeply insightful thoughts about something that we’d discussed during the class, but never managed to find an opportunity to say them out&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Not surprisingly most of the posts (about 75% of them) were written in the first half of the project. That’s partly the inevitable consequence of the novelty wearing off, but it also there have been a few other things that have come up along the way… One big thing that interacted with this 100Days project in positive way is my teaching&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I’m getting to the very end of this package tryout exercise, and I suspect this will be the last post (other than perhaps a wrap up on Friday). It’s been a mildly annoying morning: I’ve done something to my foot, I’ve been awake since 4am, and somehow my twitter feed was full of people talking about Jordan Peterson 😒 Sigh. I probably should have just blocked or muted everyone talking about him rather than engage, but what’s done is done and I’d like to enjoy the rest of my&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>So this is a post about how I set up one part of my workflow. I feel nervous about it for two reasons: Yes, I realise that I’m setting myself up to feel bad. I should stop&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The motivation to face the fear is similarly straightforward: my R code runs too slowly for some of the problems I care about. It doesn’t come up that often, to be honest. Most problems I work on are small enough that it really doesn’t matter that my R code is slow. Other problems are standard enough that I can rely on other people’s compiled code to do all the work (e.</description>

      <description>But everything is “under control” now, at least for a very expansive definition of “control”. The kids are keeping themselves occupied, I’ve responded to some overdue emails, and I’m making inroads into the Saturday morning laundry mountain. So… about that long-overdue R post… The report is a pdf document that contains all the raw data as a table that runs from pages 6 to 10; there does not seem to be any other publicly accessible version of the&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The “random walk on CRAN” project, however, has been on hold for a bit - and in truth today’s post is a bit of a cop out because there’s no package here at all and barely anything resembling code. Instead, it’s some initial thoughts about how to revisit some of my teaching material. For today though, I have a different goal… But still, it’s nice to think about what we might do if we have more&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Not wanting to give away the list of things that might appear on bingo cards (or alternatively, not actually having written all the items yet!) I’ll need to find some content to use for this post… Oh yes little network, you had me at “hello”. Here’s what we get: It’s a good start, but it’s all structure and no style! No, wait, that doesn’t work. Why? There we go. That’s pretty much the core of what I’ve done so far in generating random bingo&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Okay! It’s a Thursday evening. Solo parenting is over. My partner is back in town. The kids are in bed. Tina Turner is playing over the wireless. I’m the last one awake. Time for an R post, because that’s just the kind of girl I&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>This series of posts has been on hold for the last few days because I’ve been solo parenting and had a few deadlines at work. I have no idea how single parents&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I was working on a longer post continuing the metaprogramming series, and realised I wasn’t going to get it done this evening. But it’s been a couple of days since I tried out something new, so I resorted to the twitters to find inspiration. As always, the wonderful twitter rstats folks rose to the occasion: If I’ve understood this correctly, what the figure is showing me is what happens to the model prediction as I add the predictors in one by&amp;hellip;</description>
