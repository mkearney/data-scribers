      <description>In previous post I explained Weigted Alternating Least Squares algorithm for matrix factorization. This post will be more practical - we will build a model which will recommend artists recommendations based on history of track listenings&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Generally speaking the task for a recommender system is not to make up-sale. The real task is to keep customers engaged in your service. With loyal customers, you can monetize your service. Recommender systems is a very wide area, but in this post I won’t go into basics&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Today I will start to publish series of posts about experiments on english wikipedia. As I said before, text2vec is inspired by gensim - well designed and quite efficient python library for topic modeling and related NLP tasks. Also I found very useful Radim&amp;rsquo;s posts, where he tried to evaluate some algorithms on english wikipedia dump&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>As I know, there are few choices to connect from R to MS SQL Server: RODBC RJDBC rsqlserver But only second option can be used on mac and linux machines. Here is nice stackoverflow thread. Most of the people suggest to use microsoft sql java driver. But there is a case when this will not help - windows domain authentification&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Introduction In the next series of posts I will try to explain base concepts Locality Sensitive Hashing technique. Note, that I will try to follow general functional programming style. So I will use R&amp;rsquo;s Higher-Order Functions instead of traditional R&amp;rsquo;s *apply functions family (I suppose this post will be more readable for non R users)&amp;hellip;</description>
