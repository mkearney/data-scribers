      <description>This post grew out of some notes I was making on the differences between SparkR and sparklyr, two packages that provide an R interface to Spark. I’m currently working on a project where I’ll be interacting with data in Spark, so wanted to get a sense of options using R. Those unfamiliar with sparklyr might benefit from reading the first half of this previous post, where I cover the idea of having R objects for connections to Spark</description>

      <description>In this post I’m going to run through a brief example of using sparklyr in R. This package provides a way to connect to Spark from within R, while using the dplyr functions we all know and love. I was entirely new to Spark, and databases in general, before having a play with sparklyr. Seemingly its main rival is the more mature SparkR package. Interestingly, SparkR has a number of functions that look very similar to dplyr</description>

      <description>This post details some tips and tricks for writing a thesis/dissertation using the bookdown R package by Yihui Xie. The idea of this post is to supplement the fantastic book that Xie has written about bookdown, which can be found here. I will assume that readers know a bit about R Markdown; a decent knowledge of R Markdown is going to be essential to using bookdown. The first thing to highlight is that I’m not a pandoc or LaTeX</description>

      <description>For the Perception Action and Cognition Lab Open Science Week, 2017 (University of Leeds) I gave two talks introducing R. You can see the slides below. The code for the slides can be found over at GitHub. An introduction to R In this introduction to R I focused on tools from the tidyverse, as well as trying to provide some motivation for learning R. The audience was academics and postgraduates in a psychology</description>
