      <description>Inspiration I was having lunch with some colleagues the other day when they told me about a restaurant spreadsheet that they used to use to randomly pick a place to get lunch from. I of course felt the need to see if I could create something similar in R&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Why can’t I just have all of the data? I have been updating some code that uses data that I don’t have access to.
