      <description>Earlier this summer, while I was traveling to a conference I came across an interesting paper published by a group from the University of South Florida that explored strategies for interpreting highly variable data from long-term use of a Fitbit&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I’m a big consumer of podcasts. Ever since I started living on my own while in graduate school I’ve found that having funny and interesting people in my ears helps me get through the day&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s finally done. Eight years after I started this crazy graduate school journey I&amp;rsquo;ve successfully defended my dissertation. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, but it&amp;rsquo;s done and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier to have accomplished this milestone. Some folks have asked to see the slides, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share them here&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>When working with human behavior you’ll almost always have to deal with data that is formatted as a time series. Briefly, time series data corresponds with repeated measures of a variable (or multiple variables) at consistent intervals over a period. As my dissertation analysis is ongoing, I’m using my own Fitbit data here for this example&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to podcasts for a while. Like most people I started with the juggernaut, This American Life, but quickly opened up my catalogue to other shows and ideas&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I guess in the end you might be asking the wrong question. Of course it is hard, building cars is hard, doing astrophysics is hard, playing the cello is hard. But here we are with hundreds of cars to choose from, new PhDs staring at the stars every night, and parents enrolling their children in music lessons&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>With big money at stake it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that professional leagues and individual teams are fully embracing the big data craze. Anything and everything &amp;ldquo;for the win&amp;rdquo; has been true for centuries&amp;hellip;</description>
