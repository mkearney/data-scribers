      <description>The point about the increase in power can also be made by, instead of varying the effect size, varying the effect that can be detected with a fixed power of 0.9 when the degree of granularity in Y is increased. This is all about breaking ties in Y. The more ties there are, the less statistical information is present&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I have seen clinicians confused over statements such as &amp;ldquo;the chance of a stroke is 0.5%&amp;rdquo;, interpreting this as 50%. If we say &amp;ldquo;the chance of a stroke is 0.005&amp;rdquo; such confusion is less likely. And I don&amp;rsquo;t need percent signs everywhere. Percent change has even more problems than percent&amp;hellip;</description>
