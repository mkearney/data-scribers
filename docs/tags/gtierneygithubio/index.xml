      <description>I came across two articles recently that I thought spoke to each other in an interesting way. The first was a New York Times piece about the failings of data science firms who try to identify school shootings before they happen by social media&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I recently encountered a problem that had a surprisingly elegant solution. I struggled a lot with solving this issue, so hopefully in writing this post I can save someone else the trouble! For reasons that are irrelevant, I wanted to track the performance of youth fencers across time. National ranking lists are posted each year, but the fencersâ€™ names frequently change from year to&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The first article is quite long, but easily skim-able.

      <description>Last spring, I took a class on Bayesian statistics at the University of Chicago that had several exercises focused on building a model to classify species based on their genome.
