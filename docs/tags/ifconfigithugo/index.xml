      <description>Thou shalt above all, maintain the integrity of the network. Thou shalt have a long term strategic direction. Thou shalt always opt for quality before expediency.

      <description>First of all: autoinstall works only on the first serial interface of the router, don&amp;rsquo;t forget it. This is the topology for the small lab: R1 is a TFTP server, it stores R3 configuration in flash&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>RMON is generally an easy task, can be tricky but usually on CCIE workbooks the task are fair. The hardest part for me is to find the MIB to monitor. This is the task: monitor interface Vlan1, send a trap if it receives more than 100 packets every 30 seconds, send a trap if it goes under 50 packets every 30 seconds&amp;hellip;</description>
