      <description>Explicitly naming nodes is nonessential, but can be very useful when debugging. Oftentimes, when your Tensorflow code crashes, the error trace will refer to a specific operation. If you have many operations of the same type, it can be tough to figure out which one is problematic&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure this series will be analyzed by people with far deeper understanding of Dota than me, but in my opinion, OpenAI Five essentially won on the back of its teamfighting ability&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The computational graph is not just a nebulous, immaterial abstraction; it is a computational object that exists, and can be inspected&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>This post is my attempt to fill this gap. Rather than focusing on a specific task, I take a more general approach, and explain the fundamental abstractions underpinning Tensorflow. With a good grasp of these concepts, deep learning with Tensorflow becomes intuitive and straightforward&amp;hellip;</description>
