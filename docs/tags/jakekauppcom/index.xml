      <description>This weeks #TidyTuesday is all about global mortality rates. I’ve looked at datasets like this before, and while they are a great way to see interesting trends and practise some visualization skills, I think there is another lesson to be learned. The human element of data. These data were people. They meant something to someone&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I do not update this site as much as I would like. Interacting through twitter and the #R4DS slack channel has been my main contributions as of late to being more active in the #rstats community. I make plans to get to things like posting, then end up with other work, a neat idea, or just decide spend time with my family&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The strength of R doesn’t lie in a single programming paradigm, it lies within the warm, welcoming and ecclectic community of useRs. Like anyone who gets introduced to R, you start to look on the web for other like minded people&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in Boston, in the middle of training for marking of the Critical Thinking Assessment Test. The training is good, and their process is solid. Put that on top of a decent reliable and valid instrument and you&amp;rsquo;ve got something. I&amp;rsquo;ll need to see the results and the data to draw more conclusions, but so far I like it. Anyways.&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>So the midterm has me a bit disheartened. Not because of difficulty, but because of the miscommunication between the admin and the students. In Canvas the midterm description was set to Feb 16th 8pm EST deadline. After putting my son to bed, and while making dinner, I logged into Canvas and rushed to do the midterm&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Getting through this week was a bit tough, not due to content or complexity, but due to life, work and winter. Being the only well parent is a lot of work. Couple that with deadlines, grant writing and research sessions made for very little free time&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve made it through the first week of #IVMOOC. Gold stars all around! I did learn some new things, new tricks and new tools from the lectures and I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for a good framework&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Sometimes a simple pause leads to a time-out. Juggling parenthood, my normal hatrack of jobs, plus teaching put way to many demands on my time to devote it to #dalmooc, despite it being a very interesting experience&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Dear #Dalmooc, Unfortunately, I have to press pause for some time on my learning to tackle deadlines, wrap up teaching and evaluate my students and my teaching. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to catch up before the deadlines for the early competencies. We now return you to your regularly scheduled program, already in progress.&amp;hellip;</description>
