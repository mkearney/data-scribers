      <description>When we want to learn how to do something new in R, we all start by googling it. Having worked out simple ANOVA, next on my list is repeated measures. HAHAHAHAHA- got me…. When we were talking one-way ANOVA we used this formula. When participants contribute to all levels of condition, we need to describe that in the error term&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>It is definitely true that it takes much longer to get your data ready for analysis than it does to actually analyse it. Apparently up to 80% of the data analysis time is spent wrangling data (and cursing and swearing)&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Here is what I learned about t-tests from doing the analysis below. The AFL data that comes with Dani’s book includes attendance and score information for home and away teams over regular and finals games for years and years.

      <description>Some code that is probably going to be useful in the future: To get AAABBB use To get 1 through 8, repeated 3 times use This creates a new variable called Stimulus that grabs the 8th value of CommentName and fills the column with it&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Tom Kelly pointed me towards the @swcarpentry resources You can use dplyr::bind_rows() instead of reduce(rbind()). BUT if you want them all in one frame at the end you probably just want purrr::map_dfr(), which is a map and bind combo function&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Tibble = modern dataframe. Use instead of printing your dataset to the console. summarise(numberNA = sum(is.na(variable)) map_df(~sum(is.na(.))) na_if(&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo;) When you want help, if it helpful to helpers if you create a minimal reproudicule example so that they can see and run the code using your data. www.r4ds.co&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I have been doing lots of data wrangling recently and decided a needed a quick rundown of data cleaning in R. Turns out www.DataCamp.com has a course called exactly that.
