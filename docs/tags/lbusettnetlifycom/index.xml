      <description>After struggling a bit due to my rather nonexistent shiny skills, in the end I managed to obtain a “basic but useful” (IMO) addin. Let’s see how it works: I hope someone else will find this</description>

      <description>All is left is to run the script: Running the script will give you files like this one: , where I tweaked a bit the hugo-academic format to include bibliographic info such as volume, number, pages and doi link. The files can then be further customized to include, for example, links to pdfs, images,</description>

      <description>However, this starts to have problems over really large datasets, because the total number of comparisons to be done still rapidly increase besides the use of spatial indexes. A test done by changing the number of points in the above example in the range 25000 - 475000 shows for example this kind of behavior, for two different values of maxdist (500 and 2000 m): On the test dataset, the relationships are almost perfectly quadratic (due to the uniform distribution of</description>

      <description>We hope that the revised website will allow to navigate MODIStsp-related material much more easily than either github or the standard CRAN documentation, and will therefore help users in better and more easily exploiting MODIStsp</description>

      <description>In this case, for example, Land Surface Temperature values in the output rasters will be in °K, and spectral indices will be floating point values (e.g., NDVI will be between -1 and 1 instead than between -10000 and</description>
