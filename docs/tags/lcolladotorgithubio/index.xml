      <description>I actually don’t know much more. She passed away when I was 13 after a years long battle with disease. Google tells me that she is a co-author of at least three titles in the field of Public Health: I did inherit her souvenirs from her trips (my dad also loves them) and something that is precious to me: a medal with her name&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Last year I submitted an entry to this competition and I enjoyed the experience, even if it was a bit rushed. The process of joining the competition is relatively straight forward: You don’t need to pay for competing! You already did the very hard part of completing your Ph.D&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>These and other questions could involve time getting familiar with. Time that I could spend now, before unconf18, learning and at least getting a better sense of what to expect. Maybe I’m complicating myself and worrying too much about this&amp;hellip;</description>

Like I said, all the pieces fell in the right places this time&amp;hellip;</description>

In my case, I want to remind myself of the YAML options I frequently use (toc, fig height and width) or how to add screenshots&amp;hellip;</description>
