      <description>Having satisfied myself that there are no lingering convergence issues I can create some initial plots. First, I need to re-structure the data to make it a bit easier to plot. Okay now we can plot the results. The good news is that the imputed values largely follow the same distribution as the original&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>It is official. The program I have spent the better part of a year working on, the very centerpiece of my dissertation, works. Or at least, early indicators are in, and based on 22 cases, some of which required a great deal of manual editing, the program is returning estimates in line with&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Or… You could create a manual that is complete, easy to you use, readily tweakable, completely reproducible, and 100% shareable. Having made a couple of manuals in my time as a former camp director and current Ph.D. candidate, I appreciate well-put-together informational resources that I can consult to quickly find the answer I&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>This is the first post in a three-part blog series I am putting together. The focus of this initial post is effective exploration of the reasons for missingness in a particular set of data. The second post in the series will focus on running and evaluating the imputation model itself after having identified the appropriate covariates that help account for&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>We collected measures of these variables at three time points, approximately evenly spaced apart, and, for the purposes of these analyses, I decided to treat the data as if they were collected at precisely the same equally spaced interval for all participants. Though this is not technically true, it is sufficiently true for the purposes of these&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>As a toy problem, I am going to focus on the application of a Gaussian process model to forecasting future monthly passengers. This is not the only way one could try to solve this prediction problem. I offer it as a means of understanding the potential power that exists in using these sorts of models for prediction and imputation problems involving univariate time series&amp;hellip;</description>
