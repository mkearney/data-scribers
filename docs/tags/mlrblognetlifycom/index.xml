      <description>Introduction In July mlr got a new feature that extended the support for spatial data: The ability to visualize spatial partitions in cross-validation (CV) 9d4f3. When one uses the resampling descriptions “SpCV” or “SpRepCV” in mlr, the k-means clustering approach after Brenning (2005) is used to partition the dataset into equally sized, spatially disjoint&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Machine learning models repeatedly outperform interpretable, parametric models like the linear regression model. The gains in performance have a price: The models operate as black boxes which are not interpretable. Fortunately, there are many methods that can make machine learning models&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>With the release of the new version of mlrMBO we added some minor fixes and added a practical feature called Human-in-the-loop MBO. It enables you to sequentially visualize the state of the surrogate model, obtain the suggested parameter configuration for the next iteration and update the surrogate model with arbitrary evaluations. In the following we will demonstrate this feature on a simple&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>What is OpenML? The field of Machine Learning has grown tremendously over the last years, and is a key component of data-driven science. Data analysis algorithms are being invented and used every day, but their results and experiments are published almost exclusively in journals or separated repositories. However, data by itself has no&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>For the development of mlr as well as for an “machine learning expert” it can be handy to know what are the most popular learners used. Not necessarily to see, what are the top notch performing methods but to see what is used “out there” in the real world.
