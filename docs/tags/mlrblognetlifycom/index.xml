      <description>Introduction In July mlr got a new feature that extended the support for spatial data: The ability to visualize spatial partitions in cross-validation (CV) 9d4f3. When one uses the resampling descriptions “SpCV” or “SpRepCV” in mlr, the k-means clustering approach after Brenning (2005) is used to partition the dataset into equally sized, spatially disjoint subsets. See also this post on r-spatial.org and the mlr vignette about spatial data for more&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>This July we had the great honor to present mlr and its ecosystem at the WhyR 2018 Conference in Wroclaw in Poland. You can find the slides here. We want to thank the organizers for inviting us, providing us with great food and coffee and also many thanks all participants for showing great interest in mlr, We hope this could spark further improvement and new features as a result of the many interesting discussions we had with the&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Machine learning models repeatedly outperform interpretable, parametric models like the linear regression model. The gains in performance have a price: The models operate as black boxes which are not interpretable. Fortunately, there are many methods that can make machine learning models&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The mlr: Machine Learning in R package provides a generic, object-oriented and extensible framework for classification, regression, survival analysis and clustering for the statistical programming language R. The package targets practitioners who want to quickly apply machine learning algorithms, as well as researchers who want to implement, benchmark, and compare their new methods in a structured environment. We are happy to announce that we now offer training courses specialized on&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>With the release of the new version of mlrMBO we added some minor fixes and added a practical feature called Human-in-the-loop MBO. It enables you to sequentially visualize the state of the surrogate model, obtain the suggested parameter configuration for the next iteration and update the surrogate model with arbitrary evaluations. In the following we will demonstrate this feature on a simple example. First we need an objective function we want to&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>What is OpenML? The field of Machine Learning has grown tremendously over the last years, and is a key component of data-driven science. Data analysis algorithms are being invented and used every day, but their results and experiments are published almost exclusively in journals or separated repositories. However, data by itself has no value. It’s the ever-changing ecosystem surrounding data that gives it&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Hyperparameter tuning with mlr is rich in options as they are multiple tuning methods: Simple Random Search Grid Search Iterated F-Racing (via irace) Sequential Model-Based Optimization (via mlrMBO) Also the search space is easily definable and customizable for each of the 60+ learners of mlr using the ParamSets from the ParamHelpers Package. The only drawback and shortcoming of mlr in comparison to caret in this regard is that mlr itself does not have defaults for the search&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>For the development of mlr as well as for an “machine learning expert” it can be handy to know what are the most popular learners used. Not necessarily to see, what are the top notch performing methods but to see what is used “out there” in the real world. Thanks to the nice little package cranlogs from metacran you can at least get a slight estimate as I will show in the&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>With this post I want to show you how to benchmark several learners (or learners with different parameter settings) using several data sets in a structured and parallelized fashion. For this we want to use batchtools.

      <description>Many people who want to apply Bayesian optimization want to use it to optimize an algorithm that is not implemented in R but runs on the command line as a shell script or an executable. We recently published mlrMBO on CRAN. As a normal package it normally operates inside of R, but with this post I want to demonstrate how mlrMBO can be used to optimize an external application. At the same time I will highlight some issues you can likely run&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>We are happy to finally announce the first release of mlrMBO on cran after a quite long development time. For the theoretical background and a nearly complete overview of mlrMBOs capabilities you can check our paper on mlrMBO that we presubmitted to arxiv. The key features of mlrMBO are: Global optimization of expensive Black-Box functions. Multi-Criteria Optimization. Parallelization through multi-point proposals.

      <description>Achieving a good score on a Kaggle competition is typically quite difficult. This blog post outlines 7 tips for beginners to improve their ranking on the Kaggle leaderboards. For this purpose, I also created a Kernel for the Kaggle bike sharing competition that shows how the R package, mlr, can be used to tune a xgboost model with random search in parallel (using 16 cores). The R script scores rank 90 (of 3251) on the Kaggle&amp;hellip;</description>
