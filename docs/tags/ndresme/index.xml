      <description>Inspired by a friend&amp;rsquo;s post, I decided to plot my Facebook network. To do so, I scrapped &amp;ldquo;mutual friends&amp;rdquo; and made the following graph: Facebook friend network (click to enlarge) In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how the graph is made and how clusters are created&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>About inference Using neural networks is primarily made of 2 phases: training your model and using it. The later part can also be called inference, forward pass or evaluation. For most researchers, most of the time is used by training : they have to retrain using different architectures or different parameters&amp;hellip;</description>
