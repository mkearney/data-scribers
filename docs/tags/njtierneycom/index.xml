      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m really happy to say that Di Cook and I recently submitted our paper: &amp;ldquo;Expanding tidy data principles to facilitate missing data exploration, visualization and assessment of imputations&amp;rdquo; to JCGS . You can read the paper on arxiv here . This paper builds on the principles of tidy data to create a framework for handling, exploring, and imputing missing values. It represents the fundamental ideas that underpin the packages naniar and&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Some exciting news: I finally walked across the floor and graduated from my PhD in Statistical Sciences from QUT! The graduations was live streamed onto the TVs in our department at QUT - here&amp;rsquo;s a photo of me at the exact moment my brother yelled out &amp;ldquo;YEEAAAAHHHH NIIIICCCKK YYEEEAAAAHH&amp;rdquo; in the acoustically well designed Concert Hall at&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>A note on ggplot code style</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got some opinions about how to write ggplot code. They are based off of the official style guide , with a few of my own additions specific to ggplot2. Starting with argument names / newlines So, if there are more than two sections in a function, these should be separated on a newline. Ideally, all functions should have their argument names&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming thing - Phil Karlton ( seen in r-packages ) I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what cache invalidation is, but I certainly agree that naming things is pretty damn hard. I thought it would be interesting to share some thoughts and discussion that I&amp;rsquo;ve been having about naming packages. There was some recent discussion on tidy names on Twitter, and I felt like this was a good time to discuss this&amp;hellip;</description>

Strawberry the cab horse turning into Fledge, the Pegasus, the first talking animal of Narnia naniar is an R package that makes it easier to explore, analyse, and visualise missing data and imputed values. It is designed to be tidyverse -friendly, so it works fluidly in an analysis workflow. I encountered some pretty gnarly missing data when I first started my PhD, which was really&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I write in rmarkdown (check out that link, it&amp;rsquo;s to the new Rmarkdown book!) most days, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for the past few years. I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up a few tips along the way, and I wanted to share a couple of things I think give you a nice return on investment. Tip number 1: Save the images that you create You want to make sure that you save images you create in your rmarkdown&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had to change my R package names a few times. ggmissing became naniar. naniar became narnia. narnia went back to naniar. Every time I&amp;rsquo;ve had to do this, there were a few things I had to remember to&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Making reproducible examples can be hard. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of things you need to consider. Like, making sure your environment is clean, the right packages are loaded, the code is formatted nicely, and images are the right resolution and dimension. Getting all of these ducks lined up can sometimes take a couple of minutes, if you have a nice tightly defined problem. Other times, it can take much, much&amp;hellip;</description>
