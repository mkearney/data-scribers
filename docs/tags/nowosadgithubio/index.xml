      <description>“I would love to see an animated version of this cartogram from like 1950 to 2100”. Why not from 1800 to 2100? And why not do it using open data and open source software, so that anyone can reproduce the results? That is the aim of this post. In it, we will see how to generate the animated cartogram illustrated below&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Creating or determination of regions is a useful way to describe the world. Regionalization does not only allow for a quicker understanding of spatial patterns but also can influence how regions are managed. Regions are created in various disciplines. We can delineate regions based on a single property (e.g. landform regions or climate regions) or several factors (e.g.&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Spatial patterns are an underexplored venue of the Earth and ecological sciences. They could be both an effect of some processes and at the same time affect other ones. For example, a land cover pattern (spatial arrangement of land cover categories) could exist because of an impact of a terrain topology, soils, climate, or human action&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Imagine you have two values expressing the world population in 1950 (2.5 billion people) and 2012 (7.1 billion people). How would you compare the change in the world population? The easiest (and correct) approach is just to subtract the past value from the more recent one: We can conclude that the world population between 1950 and 2015 increased by 4&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Can you guess what are we missing in this long list? Yes, you’re (probably) right! Finding places with similar spatial patterns is not a standard spatial operation. However, it could be useful to solve many potential questions&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Take a look at the example above and compare information depicted by the compositional and co-occurrence histograms. The first one shows that each land cover category occupies a very similar proportion of the area&amp;hellip;</description>
