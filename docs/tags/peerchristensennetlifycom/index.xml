      <description>Improving the look of figures in ggplot2 is fairly simple. For consistency, weâ€™ll create a clean and simple theme based on the APA theme from the jtools package and change some of the features. The background colour will be set to a light grey hue. The grid lines are omitted in the APA theme. Given that our reviews are in Danish, we can use the happyorsad package to compute a sentiment score for each review.</description>

      <description>We see that the text variable contains one line of text for each row. Given this format, we can create a new data frame with a row for each word token found in the Bing lexicon of sentiment words. By using this lexicon, sentiment words are simpky assigned a value of positive or negative. Have a look at the other options with ?get_sentiments. We will try using the nrc lexicon later on.</description>
