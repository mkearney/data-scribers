      <description>Before we look at the details of the materialization of the object, let‚Äôs review the various ALTREP methods. The number of elements is simply the number of elements of the input: The critical part is the implementation of the materialization&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve used it to make a simple function that gives the names of the functions in a Go file: So following the pattern I‚Äôve used in my previous go adventures, here is another Go function that sits between the real pure go code we‚Äôve seen before, and the R things&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I was a bright kid, and everybody in the family was surprised when I picked up reading on my own (that‚Äôs at least the story I‚Äôve heard many times). After some tests I skipped two classes and things still were easy. I‚Äôm not writing this to brag, quite the opposite&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The real problem however is that because you know it was broken already, you just don‚Äôt pay attention so you don‚Äôt have a way to quickly assert if you have just added a new üêû, and then you live in fear&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Next we allocate some data structures. Then, the results vector, where we will collect the anagrams. I just hope however that walking through the code is useful&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Here I am again at the conundrum of choosing a name for a thing. This is hard, I like when it‚Äôs over and I have the perfect name, and I feel finally free to try to match the personnality of code to the name&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Four issues (and then some comments to other issues) feels minimal, but this includes getting back on track with the codebase and setup a more formal way of contributing, i.e.¬†through pull requests, reviews, and systematic testing. Today is another day, so I‚Äôll work on another project&amp;hellip;</description>
