      <description>I am a big fan of scikit-learn&amp;rsquo;s pipelines. Why are pipelines useful? Ensure reproducibility Export models to JSON for production models Enforce structure in preprocessing and hyperparameter search to avoid over-optimistic error estimates Unfortunately though, there are a number of sklearn modules not well integrated with pipelines&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>After one too many Liquid errors and all the Ruby dependency hell, I&amp;rsquo;m moving away from Jekyll to Hugo. One less excuse to keep me from posting. A handful of things to note about Hugo: Built with Go. Easy to use. It&amp;rsquo;s fast. So fast. Local site rebuilds in ~100ms. Immediate feedback as you&amp;rsquo;re writing because fast. Getting started with Hugo is pretty easy&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The following post describes how to install TensorFlow 0.6 on an Amazon EC2 Instance with GPU Support. I also created a Public AMI (ami-e191b38b) with the resulting setup. Feel free to use it. UPDATED (28 Jan 2016): The latest TensorFlow build requires Bazel 0.1.4. Post now reflects this. Thanks to Jim Simpson for his assistance&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Apache Spark is a great way for performing large-scale data processing. Lately, I have begun working with PySpark, a way of interfacing with Spark through Python. After a discussion with a coworker, we were curious whether PySpark could run from within an IPython Notebook&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Today, I take my first shots at ranking Major League Baseball (MLB) teams. I see my efforts at prediction and ranking an ongoing process so that my models improve, the data I incorporate are more meaningful, and ultimately my predictions are largely accurate. For the first attempt, let&amp;rsquo;s rank MLB teams using the Bradley-Terry (BT) model&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Much of my research in machine learning is aimed at small-sample, high-dimensional bioinformatics data sets. For instance, here is a paper of mine on the topic. A large number of papers proposing new machine-learning methods that target high-dimensional data use the same two data sets and consider few others&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Recently I started playing with Kaggle. I quickly became frustrated that in order to download their data I had to use their website. I prefer instead the option to download the data programmatically. After some Googling, the best recommendation I found was to use lynx&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Earlier, I found an interesting post from Bo Allen on pseudo-random vs random numbers, where the author uses a simple bitmap (heat map) to show that the rand function in PHP has a systematic pattern and compares these to truly random numbers obtained from random.org&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Occasionally, I will query Google with “statistics conferences”, “machine learning conferences” or “pattern recognition conferences” and the like. But often, it is difficult to obtain anything meaningful other than the conferences of which I&amp;rsquo;m already aware (such as JSM, ICML, some IEEE conferences). Today, I found WikiCFP, which is a A Wiki for Calls for Papers&amp;hellip;</description>
