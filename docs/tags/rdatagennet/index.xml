      <description>A couple of interesting things to note here. First is that the coefficient estimates are pretty similar to the beta regression model. However, the standard errors are slightly higher, as they should be, since we are using only observed probabilities and not the true (albeit randomly selected or generated) probabilities&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>In the second scenario, each successive exposure continues to add to the effect, but each additional intervention adds a little less. The first intervention adds 0.8, the second adds 0.6, the third adds 0.4, and the fourth adds 0.2. This is a form of interaction&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Recently, I was helping an investigator plan a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial to study the effects of modifying a physician support system on patient-level diabetes management. While analytic approaches for power calculations do exist in the context of this complex study design, it seemed worth the effort to be explicit about all of the assumptions&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>In this case, we have nine different combinations of the four characteristics, four of which include only a single school (rows 2, 4, 7, and 8). Stratification wouldn’t work necessarily work here if our goal was balance across all four characteristics&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I learned statistics and probability by simulating data. Sure, I did the occasional proof, but I never believed the results until I saw it in a simulation. I guess I have it backwards, but I that’s just the way I am&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Everyone knows that loops in R are to be avoided, but vectorization is not always possible</title>

      <description>Again, the specifics of the simulation are not important here. What is important, is the notion that the problem requires looking through individual data sequentially, something R is generally not so good at when the sequences get particularly long, and they must be repeated a large number of times&amp;hellip;</description>
