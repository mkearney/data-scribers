      <description>More info: Now this is very good already with hardly any overlapping labels and the world is pretty recognisable. And really, you can make this plot with just 2 lines of code: So what these two lines make is already very amazing. This gives continents a much better shape, but it does severaly misplace Polynesia. See if you can find where, e.g&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing data science for over 10 years now. Although most of this time I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise I was doing data science. I thought I was just doing normal science but focusing on simulations and data analysis, rather than field or lab work&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Left Edinburgh at 8am for a 1pm ferry Kennacraig to Port Askaig (Islay). Edinburgh-Kennacraig should be a 3.5h drive (and it was), but we left early to allow for any delays on the road. Arrived on Islay at 3pm and our accommodation near Port Ellen (southern Islay, close to to Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroiaig) was a 40 min drive from the port&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I wrote my last blog post on Wordpress on 20-October 2017 and promised myself this was the last time. I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging on Wordpress since 2014 and the more I used it the more painful it got!
