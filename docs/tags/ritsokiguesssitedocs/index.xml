      <description>I seem to have Disqus comments enabled now. The crucial thing appeared to be the disqus.html file written by Yihui Xie. I changed the disqus shortname given there to mine, added my shortname to the disqusShortname in config.toml, and it seems to work&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I just discovered a couple of things: an R Studio add-in called CRANsearcher that, when you run it, prompts you for search terms and searches the whole of CRAN for anything that matches those search terms. (Thanks to @juliasilge on Twitter for this&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I suppose I should have ridden Victoria Park on Victoria Day, but I didn’t: When the wind is blowing from the west, don’t ride out to the east! My new phone now has Human on it, which works better than on the tablet (so I uninstalled it from there)&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Today’s walk comes in two parts, with a pause for lunch between. Part 1: From Broadview station, across past the Pizza Pizza, and (carefully) across the entrance ramp to the DVP, and then down the “secret” path: crossing the entrance ramp on a rather dilapidated-looking bridge: I am never quite sure about the next bit&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>For my last post, I had a lot of trouble finding out how to make the images appear. It turns out that the secret is to save them in the static folder, and then to treat that folder as the “root” (that is, start its name with a forward slash) when making the R Markdown for the image&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>A short walk today around the back of the S wing at UTSC. This is the side of the S wing that nobody sees; it has the concrete brutalism of the outside wall (no entrances from this side) up against the forest that leads down to Highland Creek. You don’t meet too many people around here&amp;hellip;</description>
