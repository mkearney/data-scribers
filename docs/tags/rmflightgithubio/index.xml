      <description>I’ve never had a woman tell me she was assaulted by anyone either, but given my past behavior, even if someone I knew had, I don’t think my actions made me someone that a woman would trust to tell.

      <description>Now, this makes sense. Some sources of irreproducibility include, but are not limited to: The other measures they used in this paper are also very nice, in plotting the median correlation of a sample against all other samples, and the fraction of outlier features in a given sample (see figure 2 of Gierlinkski et al)&amp;hellip;</description>
