      <description>To save time, I’m gonig to used saved versions of the datasets I built up over the 5 blog posts. I won’t include the functions in this blog post either, but the article uses (at most very slight modified) functions from the previous 5 posts.

      <description>Now that we have the teams for each county, we want to work out how well they would do at a world cup. For this, we need to know roughly what their ranking would be compared to actual nations&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>First, we need a list of plausible formations, and the positions they contain. There’s a handy list of the default FIFA18 formations online which we’ll scrape&amp;hellip;</description>
