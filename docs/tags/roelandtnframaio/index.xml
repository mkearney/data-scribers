      <description>Last updated: 2018-09-03 I know, I know, my last post was 2 months ago. I’m not very steady but lots have been done on other things (FOSS4G-fr 2018 program, a bread recipe that I can manage, writing a python course from scratch, that kind of things). Next step in my life will be in September at the end of my Master degree. I don’t know what I will do at that time but I know what I want to&amp;hellip;</description>

So when more experimented people like them advise to use a tool, it is for a reason. So I decided to give it a try. Not to compare save() and saveRDS, but saveRDS to&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I recently discover a R package, called liftr package. It allows the build of pdf document (and html files, but i didn&amp;rsquo;t test it) from a Rmarkdown file. Fully integrated in RStudio, the R code is executed (and other code as well, I tried python) and results are displayed. You don&amp;rsquo;t even need to have LaTeX on your computer, since the document compilation take place in a docker&amp;hellip;</description>
