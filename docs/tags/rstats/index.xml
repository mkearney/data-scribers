      <description>This post has lots in common with previous posts on “the layered presentation of graphics”. It is about building up plots, but now with a focus on this incramental change for teaching ggplot2.

I appreciate that none of this may be novel, but I needed to get it written down and out of my head.

      <description>Introduction In July mlr got a new feature that extended the support for spatial data: The ability to visualize spatial partitions in cross-validation (CV) 9d4f3. When one uses the resampling descriptions “SpCV” or “SpRepCV” in mlr, the k-means clustering approach after Brenning (2005) is used to partition the dataset into equally sized, spatially disjoint&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I think it is more straight forward than messing around with alpha. Several folks brought up geom_blank() having looked at the previous implementation, but I didn’t find it necessary in this case if you are using last_plot() which I think it makes sense to do in this context. Still, geom_blank is good to know about. This time around, I’ll do a little with labeling&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Where should you declare aesthetics? Globally or in the geom_*() function? The answer to this question, in some sense is personal preference, because there are simply different ways to get the same job done in the ggplot architecture. My preference is declaring all aesthetic mappings as global unless there are conflicts. Below is an example that, I hope, will persuade you to my&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The motivation to face the fear is similarly straightforward: my R code runs too slowly for some of the problems I care about. It doesn’t come up that often, to be honest. Most problems I work on are small enough that it really doesn’t matter that my R code is slow. Other problems are standard enough that I can rely on other people’s compiled code to do all the work&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>My limited goals: Perhaps the central difference between working in the Stata environment and in R is that in R you always have to be declaring which data frame you are working with. In Stata, you just have one active data frame and then you can refer to the variables by their names alone. The tidyverse tools with piping make working in R feel more like working in Stata in my&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>This post will provide an R code-heavy, math-light introduction to selecting the (k) in k means. It presents the main idea of kmeans, demonstrates how to fit a kmeans in R, provides some components of the kmeans fit, and displays some methods for selecting k. In addition, the post provides some helpful functions which may make fitting kmeans a bit&amp;hellip;</description>

Therefore, you can’t just push a series of packages to Launchpad and walk away. In order to ensure the dependencies are built, you need to wait until they have been published in the PPA.

You can add error bars, but you don’t know if you are looking at standard error or standard&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>You have a data frame you want to alter using piping, something like this. As far as bugs go, this is fairly inconsequential. However, it took me a while to debug the error on a somewhat complicated 15 line pipe with ggplot, because of the inconsistency in the error R spat out as well as the innocuousness of the causitive&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>My aim is to show this through a couple of data simulations that allow us to see this visually. Now let’s generate some data and look at it: Since we have repeated measurements for each cluster (the two potential outcomes), we can transform this into a “longitudinal” data set, though the periods are not time but different&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Yesterday, a tweet caught my eye. It was something that I know I’d seen before, but it somehow had escaped my memory as to what it was called or how it was constructed. Well, it bugged me enough that I had to track it down. As I am currently neck deep in writing an annual risk report it’d be easy for me to agree with the thought. So, let’s play with them in the googleVis package for&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I learned statistics and probability by simulating data. Sure, I did the occasional proof, but I never believed the results until I saw it in a simulation. I guess I have it backwards, but I that’s just the way I am. And now that I am a so-called professional, I continue to use simulation to understand models, to do sample size estimates and power calculations, and of course to&amp;hellip;</description>

For those of you who don’t know, RDS is an easy way to create a database in the cloud. In this post, I won’t be showing you how to setup an RDS instance, but I will show you how to connect to it if you have one running.</description>

      <description>Again, the specifics of the simulation are not important here. What is important, is the notion that the problem requires looking through individual data sequentially, something R is generally not so good at when the sequences get particularly long, and they must be repeated a large number of times. As you can see, things got markedly&amp;hellip;</description>
