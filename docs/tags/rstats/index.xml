      <description>Anyway, if a software package seems to try to turn an average user into a sysadmin, that is probably not a good sign. Ummm&amp;hellip; R CMD javareconf? Java 8? 9? JDK 10? sudo? Actually I did figure out how to install it, but it was a long way&amp;hellip; I was afraid that I would have to go through this again in the future (like I did for a few times in the past), so I chose not to touch it again&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I thought I would spend all my PhD reading textbooks and learning new R techiniques (see below). However research, admin, and teaching can get in the way!

In order to ensure the dependencies are built, you need to wait until they have been published in the PPA&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I wrote a really quick script to install R packages from the command line that I thought I’d share. It doesn’t really do a great deal, but you can use it to install one package at a time. Save the below as rpkginstall and make sure it’s executable with chmod + x rpkginstall. Then you can install a package like this example, which would install dplyr, &amp;hellip;</description>

Still, CircleCI has some advantages: Though Travis can cache the setup once it succeeds, it is good if we can save time to setup testing environment by using existing Docker images. CircleCI displays the test summary in this pretty way: All I had to do was two steps&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Overview In this post I will compare the use and performance of dplyr and data.table for the purposes of “split apply combine” style analysis, with some comparisons to base R methods.

      <description>I’m also really interested in statistical learning as a family of modeling techniques, a kind of fitting them together very well and forming a grammer of models. You can make a new model by joing things together, just like the grammer of graphics by which you can come up with a new graphic that is just a new arrangment of existing&amp;hellip;</description>

I have to improve my troubleshooting skills and go deeper in some technologies but I think I can do it.

      <description>RMON is generally an easy task, can be tricky but usually on CCIE workbooks the task are fair. The hardest part for me is to find the MIB to monitor. This is the task: monitor interface Vlan1, send a trap if it receives more than 100 packets every 30 seconds, send a trap if it goes under 50 packets every 30 seconds&amp;hellip;</description>
