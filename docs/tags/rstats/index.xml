      <description>Neural Processes (NPs) caught my attention as they essentially are a neural network (NN) based probabilistic model which can represent a distribution over stochastic processes. So NPs combine elements from two worlds: Both have their advantages and drawbacks&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Where should you declare aesthetics? Globally or in the geom_*() function? The answer to this question, in some sense is personal preference, because there are simply different ways to get the same job done in the ggplot architecture. My preference is declaring all aesthetic mappings as global unless there are conflicts&amp;hellip;</description>

I learned how to develop packages to complement my research and to also improve workflow Learn from examples! Eg, this presentation was based off Alison Hill’s R Ladies talk about blogdown!

      <description>One of the challenges with using Launchpad is that once a package is built, it needs to be published. This takes some time (around 20 minutes). Therefore, you can’t just push a series of packages to Launchpad and walk away. In order to ensure the dependencies are built, you need to wait until they have been published in the PPA&amp;hellip;</description>

But what to train my first Deep Learning network in R on? I’m neither a Cats nor a Dogs person. Whatever, I do what I want! South Park vs. Simpsons!

Like, making sure your environment is clean, the right packages are loaded, the code is formatted nicely, and images are the right resolution and dimension. Getting all of these ducks lined up can sometimes take a couple of minutes, if you have a nice tightly defined problem. Other times, it can take much, much&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve made it through the first week of #IVMOOC. Gold stars all around! I did learn some new things, new tricks and new tools from the lectures and I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for a good framework&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Introduction In the next series of posts I will try to explain base concepts Locality Sensitive Hashing technique. Note, that I will try to follow general functional programming style. So I will use R&amp;rsquo;s Higher-Order Functions instead of traditional R&amp;rsquo;s *apply functions family (I suppose this post will be more readable for non R users)&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Today I’m introducing new version of rmongodb (which I started to maintain) – v1.8.0. Install it from github: library(devtools) install_github(&amp;ldquo;mongosoup/rmongodb@v1.8.0&amp;rdquo;) Release version will be uploaded to CRAN shortly. This release brings a lot of improvements to rmongodb: Now rmongodb correctly handles arrays. mongo.bson.to&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I’m also really interested in statistical learning as a family of modeling techniques, a kind of fitting them together very well and forming a grammer of models. You can make a new model by joing things together, just like the grammer of graphics by which you can come up with a new graphic that is just a new arrangment of existing&amp;hellip;</description>
