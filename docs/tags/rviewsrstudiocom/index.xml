      <description>Fortunately, package developers have provided some very useful tools, if you know where to look. :) This post presents a search strategy based on some relatively new packages I have come across in my monthly review. The next line of code just selects the columns we will be using&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I asked a good friend at work to help me test the sample app provided in this post. She was able to run it easily, but then told me that she didn’t know that she was supposed to click on things. Adding interactive plots is one of the most important capabilities to include in a Shiny app&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Let’s make our changes to both goods and services in the data. I’m also going to replace a few other accounts with shorter names, e.g., I will use “Govt” for “Government consumption expenditures and gross investment”.

      <description>I concluded that most people just don’t need to build them that big! So now, I would like to explain why we needed such a large app and how we went about building it. To give you an idea of the scale I am talking about, an automotive metaphor might be useful. A typical Shiny app I see in my daily work has about 50 or even fewer interaction items&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Let’s get to it! That plot is nice, but it’s static! Hover on it and you’ll see what I mean. First, we isolate the most recent month by filtering on the last date. We also don’t want the ADP Estimate and filter that out as well. Finally, let’s compare the ADP Estimates to the actual Nonfarm payroll numbers since 2017&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Traditionally, moving this model into production has involved one of two approaches: either running customer data through the model on a batch basis and caching the results in a database, or handing the model definition off to a development team to translate the work done in R into another language, such as Java or Scala&amp;hellip;</description>
