      <description>I asked a good friend at work to help me test the sample app provided in this post. She was able to run it easily, but then told me that she didn’t know that she was supposed to click on things. Adding interactive plots is one of the most important capabilities to include in a Shiny app&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Let’s make our changes to both goods and services in the data. I’m also going to replace a few other accounts with shorter names, e.g., I will use “Govt” for “Government consumption expenditures and gross investment”. We now have 25 accounts, each with 285 observations&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I concluded that most people just don’t need to build them that big! So now, I would like to explain why we needed such a large app and how we went about building it. To give you an idea of the scale I am talking about, an automotive metaphor might be useful. A typical Shiny app I see in my daily work has about 50 or even fewer interaction items&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>It all starts with sandboxes. Development sandboxes are dedicated safe spaces for experimentation and creativity. A sandbox is a place where you can go to test and break things, without the ramifications of breaking the real, important things&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Let’s get to it! That plot is nice, but it’s static! Hover on it and you’ll see what I mean. First, we isolate the most recent month by filtering on the last date. We also don’t want the ADP Estimate and filter that out as well. Finally, let’s compare the ADP Estimates to the actual Nonfarm payroll numbers since 2017&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>JSM 2018 is almost here! Usually around this time, I comb through the entire program manually making an itinerary for myself. But this year I decided to try something new – a programmatic way of going through the program, and then building a Shiny app that helps me better navigate the online program&amp;hellip;</description>
