      <description>Accurate prediction of player performance is of immense value to those of use who play fantasy football. With this in mind, I was curious about how well simple prediction models could perform in this context. Conveniently, Sean J&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Previously I use data from armchair analysis to build a simple model to predict whether an NFL player would have an injury based only on their position. I restricted the analysis to QBs, RBs, TEs, and WRs&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Anyone trying to learn how to build and assess prediction models is immediately swamped with a litany of strange sounding performance metrics. In the binary outcome case you might encounter: sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, accuracy, just to name a few&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Yesterday I wrote a post using Stan to fit simple one parameter models. These are boring, but helpful for learning the basics. Today, I’d like to start building a series of increasingly complicated regression models&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Introduction Super Learning is a conceptually simple way of combining predictions from different models using cross validation. It simply uses the cross-validated results to form an optimal weighted combination of predictions&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Introduction A common misconception about randomized clinical trials is that the randomization process should balance any particular covariate across the arms of the trial and that therefore there is no benefit to controlling for covariates with a regression model unless a particular covariate happens to be unbalanced by&amp;hellip;</description>
