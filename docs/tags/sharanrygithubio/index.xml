      <description>I would like to thank my mentor Colin Carroll and the whole PyMC team for constantly guiding and supporting me and reviewing my code during the GSoC project. It was my privilege working with the PyMC community&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>This post is an effort to demonstrate and provide possible solutions for tensorflow&amp;rsquo;s graph problem with PyMC4. Recall that TensorFlow represents calculations as a computation graph, and even for very simple models, the PyMC4 computation graph can be very complex&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>We are finally at a state where we can demonstrate the use of the PyMC4 API side by side with PyMC3 and showcase the consistency in results by using non-centered eight schools model. I will be comparing the PyMC3 and PyMC4 way of doing the same task&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Its been a month since the coding period of GSoC has started. My first evaluations are done. I have passes it successfully thanks to my mentor Colin. :) First few weeks of the coding period was spent familiarizing myself with the basic concepts of Bayesian Inference&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I have been selected for Google Summer of Code(GSoC) 2018! :D *All models in PyMC3 are defined using such a class. This blog is one of GSoC&amp;rsquo;s requirements&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Unsupervised way of representing text in order to produce task independent vector representations. Current processes mostly use compositional operators that map word vectors to sentense vectors using various deep learning methods&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>For quite some time researchers thought backpropagation wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work as it might get stuck in a local minima, but analysis showed that this rarely happened. There might be many saddle points at which the algorithm might get stuck, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter which one as they all almost had the same objective value&amp;hellip;</description>
