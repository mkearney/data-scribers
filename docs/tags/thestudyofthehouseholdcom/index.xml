      <description>Most ecologists would agree: it‚Äôs really hard to predict which animals are going to be where, and how many of them you might find when you look. Lately, there has been lots of interest in using mixed-effects models to make these predictions&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>What this post is about I have been thinking a lot lately about the importance of centering variables. This is something that has earned me eyerolls and scorn from my nearest collaborators, because it is so basic&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>What are your weaknesses as a scientist? What should we do when we become aware of those weaknesses, or when someone makes us aware? Backstory: Several months ago I started doing Crossfit here in France1. It‚Äôs been a fun way to meet new people and get some exercise&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s where my reading took me this week. Some of it is ecology, but a lot of it is other, random things that came to me via Twitter or from friends. Perhaps this will become a regular post for me! Favourite paper Paine et al. on a wonderful idea of integrating demography and traits to predict community dynamics&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I can be skeptical, even anxious, about ecology ‚Äì particularly about methods and data quality. However, ‚Äúanxiety can be cultivated into Wisdom‚Äù (McElreath, 2015). This is my mission for myself, and this post might be one of a series attempting this cultivation&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Earlier this week I wrote out a multilevel model. It had fit well (though slowly) and I spent a happy hour admiring the chains, checking the coefficients, plotting posterior values. Life was good and easy; merrily did I sail before a fair breeze and a clear sky. My next port of call was to plot some smooth fitted lines, aka ‚Äúcounterfactual predictions‚Äù. Ah yes&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Last week or so, I achieved a wonderous thing. A trivial thing. I acheived a wondrous, trivial thing: I wrote my most popular tweet ever: My new thing is ending every Rmd with a list of links to the forums / SO questions / blogs / github repos that I used to solve the problem #rstats pic.twitter&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Ever since I moved to France for my postdoc in September 2016, I‚Äôve tried to practice French whenever I can. One easy way to do that is by consuming YouTube channels in French ‚Äì great things to put on the the background while I make food for my son, or feed my son, or clean up after feeding my son, etc&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Yesterday I asked my beloved Twitter nerds to recommend to me their favourite quantitative texts in Ecology: my postdoc super tells me I can BUY BOOKS! üíìüìöüìöüíì quick sweet friends, what are your fun statistical ecology book recommendations? - Andrew MacDonald (@polesasunder) December 2, 2016 As a way of saying &amp;ldquo;Thank you!&amp;rdquo; I thought that I would put all the books in a list for anyone who is&amp;hellip;</description>
