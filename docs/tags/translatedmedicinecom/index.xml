      <description>This post is inspired by #tidytuesday. Coffee is the life force for many healthcare workers. Here too, the age old question arises: Dunkin or Starbucks? Sometimes, it just comes down to proximity. We need coffee and we need it now! So, I decided to see what chain was closest to each hospital in Massachusetts.

      <description>Inspired by my wife’s work in educating students who are English Learners, this post visualizes the English Learners across Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Department of Education publishes a large amount of education data from across the state. It provides yearly percentages of enrolled student and their characteristics, including English Learners. English Learners are defined as students age 3-21 who were not born in the US or whose native language is not&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Inspire by Julia Silge and the tidycensus package by Kyle Walker, I wanted to explore the limited English proficient (LEP) population in Suffolk County (which includes Boston). For those, not in the know, LEP refers people who speak English less than very well. Beyond the overall population, I wanted to get a glimpse into the language diversity of the area. So, I started with the Spanish LEP population here we&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I recently spotted a time series heat map. So I started on a quest to make my own. Luckily, I found some local data to start with: crimes in Somerville, MA.

      <description>In the first three parts of this series, we looked at the changes in income along the The Orange Line, The Red Line, and The Green Line. I went through my approach for creating a New Yorker inspired visualization of income along the Boston T. For the final post, we take a look at the The Blue Line. Below you will see median household income along each of the four lines of the Boston Blue&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>As a native New Yorker, I was recently intrigued by a visualization of household income in NY highlight inequality ( New Yorker ).

      <description>It was two o’clock on a Tuesday afternoon and Abigail* was in the emergency room for the third time this month. I was able to step away from the day-to-day struggles of the general inpatient medicine floors to see her in the emergency department. I had promised to keep her out of the hospital, and I had failed again.
