      <description>Further data cleaning is needed to reformat the datetime and rename a column. We can also save the animation into gif files, instead of embedding the animation. R and related packages are able to conveniently draw both static and animated maps for tracking hurricanes or typhoons. Further analysis, such as real-time tracking of hurricanes, will be conducted in the&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientistâ€™s experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. There are also some packages required to reproduce this post. If you have not installed them, please run the following codes. After installing all the libraries, we should include them in the R session to run the following&amp;hellip;</description>
