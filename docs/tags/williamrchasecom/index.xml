      <description>Drama, intrigue, arrogance, dashed hopes, rock-bottom, perseverance, and eventual triumph, this post has it all! It starts with me watching Rachael Tatman’s recent live-coding video, and ends with a thrilling race-to-the-bottom between two pathetically slow functions&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Yes, hello, you&amp;rsquo;ve arrived. Finally, we&amp;rsquo;re ready to build a phylogenetic tree. By this point you should have a nice clean multiple sequence alignment (if not, read my previous posts in this series)&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Is Hadley Wickham a Cat or Dog Person</title>

      <description>Based on who Hadley follows, I’m going to give this round to dogs. Sure Hadley follows a couple of people that mention cats in their descriptions, but I can forgive him. After all, some of my best friends are cat people (don’t worry, I’m working on converting them)&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I really like this CV template-I think it&amp;rsquo;s stylish, but not too flashy to distract from the material. I worked out some bugs with the responsiveness and tested on all viewports, but let me know if there are any problems there&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>So what do now? Well the truth is that I compared sequences from all three sources, tried to minimize differences between them, and then just sent that off for synthesis. Does the sequence I sent off match any of the sources exactly? No&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Hi, in this series of posts, I’ll introduce a general workflow for estimating a phylogenetic tree for a single gene. When learning phylogenetics, I often got lost in the dizzying array of tools and methods available for sequence alignment and tree building&amp;hellip;</description>
