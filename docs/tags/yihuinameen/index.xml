      <description>First of all, the main purpose of caching is speed. The basic idea is simple: if you know you are going to compute the same thing, you may just load the result saved from the previous run, and skip the computing this time. There are two keywords here: &amp;ldquo;the same thing&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;the saved result&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Personally I don&amp;rsquo;t really care about if a project is &amp;ldquo;sticky&amp;rdquo;, and I believe being magnetic is a lot more difficult and valuable than being sticky for an open source project. Okay, that is a little bit digression for this blog post. If you use the Homebrew version of R, it will be super easy to upgrade or remove R in the future&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Many people don&amp;rsquo;t understand the point of Markdown, especially those LaTeX users. They don&amp;rsquo;t understand why we invest so much time in such a simple and weak authoring language.

You may spend too much time on features of software, and even forget what you actually need to do (e.g&amp;hellip;</description>
